To say that his vocal ability was a shock is an understatement. Willie wowed the audience a shocking country bass vocal, singing “Your Man” by <strong>Josh Turner</strong>. The juxtaposition of his look and his sound was exciting and her earned four yes votes from the judges!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Up next was <strong>Kelvin McMangle</strong>, who doesn’t deserve much written about him. He mumbled about working with lawnmower handles, forgot what his song was called, and then sang something that was brutally unrecognizable. He, of course, was sent away, but not before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> joked, “I’m scared I’m related to you or something.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of the evening’s best singers came out next, 18-year-old <strong>Julia Bullock</strong>. Julia was a member of a band and we were treated to an incredibly awkward moment with her ex-bandmate and ex-boyfriend Christian, who is extremely bitter that Julia wants to make it on her own. And make it on her she did! She sang a great version of “Pumped Up Kicks” by Foster The People and earned yes votes from all the judges. <strong>L.A. Reid</strong> noted that she was “exactly what I’ve been looking for.” Ex-BF Christian couldn’t even clap. Way to be cool, Christian!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The less I say about that Pepsi Flavor tasting, the better, because, seriously? Dumb.</p><h3>Here Comes The Crazy</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>The drama of the night began when 21-year-old hairdresser <strong>Krysten Colon</strong> hit the stage. She performed a mediocre version of <strong>Adele</strong>‘s “Don’t You Remember,” and Simon said she was trying too hard to mimic Adele, cutting her off quickly. He offered, though, a rare opportunity to come back and sing again with a song that was more expressive. Judging by what she did with that opportunity, Simon probably wished he could take his very generous offer back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>But before we could continue with the crazy that was Krysten, we were treated to the delightful <strong>Jeffrey Gutt</strong>. Jeffrey, 36 and a single dad, was so adorable with his son, Talon. Luckily, he was also a major rockstar, taking the most overdone song in audition history (<strong>Leonard Cohen</strong>‘s “Hallelujah”) and bringing his awesome rocker growl to it. I’ll admit, he pronounced some of the lyrics kind-of weirdly, but it was a great performance in a night sorely lacking in them. He, of course, scores yes votes.</p><h3>Take It As A Sign</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>After Jeffrey, the stadium was hit by lightning, which should’ve been a sign to just call it a day because the montage of terrible that followed should have been avoided. As Simon noted, “Everything’s gone wrong.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>But not wrong enough because Krysten hadn’t come back yet. Saving the worst for last, she hit the stage and completely underwhelmed on <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>‘s “I Have Nothing.” Somehow, she was worse than before, entirely unable to hit any of the higher notes or control her breathing. As a monumental thunderclap cut her song short, totally freaking Britney out, Krysten pleaded that she “was just about to blow it,” which was an odd choice of words. L.A. replied, “You already blew it,” and the judges sent her on her way.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Once backstage, she threw a truly embarrassing tantrum — crying, yelling at people trying to comfort her, throwing water on a camera. By the time she had lifted a folding chair in the air, her poor mother looked mortified. Krysten then ran out into the rain, hopefully never to be seen from again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>What did you think of tonight’s episode, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
