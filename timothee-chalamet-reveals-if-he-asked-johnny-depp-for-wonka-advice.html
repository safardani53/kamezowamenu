So, that was the learning curve. But once it was in full swing, then it felt like we were cookin.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The&nbsp;Lady Bird&nbsp;star’s film comes amid his romance with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, 26, who reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attended the premiere</a> in London. A source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>on November 29 that although <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kardashians</a>&nbsp;star wasn’t spotted on the red carpet, she did show up to the event for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her beau</a>. The insider also revealed that Kylie popped by the afterparty to support Timmy and the rest of the cast. Fans in the U.S. can catch&nbsp;Wonka&nbsp;in theaters beginning December 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FyZq2hnaTBqbHEZpqhmZyWuqbAjKucr52RocButcVmn55lkai4prCMo6ahpp6ueqWxz6lkn6eiYsSwusqaZJqcpp6wpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stanley-stanczyk.html><span>←</span><span>Stanley Stanczyk</span></a>
