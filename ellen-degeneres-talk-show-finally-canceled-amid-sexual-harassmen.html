such an abrupt reassessment as Ellen DeGeneres – and that’s saying a lot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/07/ellen-degeneres-tries-to-smile-683x1024.jpg><p>Just a few short months ago, Ellen was regarded as TV’s most ebullient do-gooder – a ray or sunshine in a world where cynicism and sarcasm reign supreme.</p><p>These days, she’s viewed by many as one of Hollywood’s greatest villains.</p><p>That may sound hyperbolic, but the allegations against her are made all the more unforgivable by the fact that Ellen concealed her dark side so effectively.</p><p>Numerous employees and former employees have come forward over the past few months to <a href=#>complain about the toxic work environment</a>&nbsp;on the set of Ellen’s wildly popular daytime talk show.</p><p>The situation has escalated to the point where it is currently <a href=#>under investigation by DeGeneres’ bosses</a> at Telepictures and Warner, and new allegations continue to surface on a daily basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Now, shocking new claims about sexual harassment on set make it seem almost inevitable that <a href=#>Ellen’s show will get canceled</a> in order to ensure that no further abuse is allowed to take place on set.</p><p>The latest allegations are aimed at Kevin Leman, Ellen’s longtime executive producer and head writer.</p><p>According to a shocking <a href=#>new report</a>&nbsp;from BuzzFeed, Leman groped employees and made inappropriate remarks about their appearances on a regular basis, and his behavior went unchecked for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/ellen-degeneres-accepts-720x1024.jpg><p>One former employee says Leman asked him if he would perform oral sex in the bathroom at a company party in 2013.</p><p>Another says the executive frequently made cringe-worthy comments on the bulges in male employees’ pants.</p><p>BuzzFeed spoke with “nearly a dozen” former employees who confirmed that it was not uncommon to see Leman grope male staffers and ask inappropriate questions like, “Are you a top or a bottom?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/ellen-degeneres-accepts-720x1024.jpg><p>“It’s masked in sarcasm, but it’s not sarcasm,” one former employee told the outlet</p><p>“He’d probably do it in front of 10 people and they’d laugh because ‘it’s just Kevin being Kevin,’ but if you’re in a position of power at a company, you don’t just get to touch me like that,” another said.</p><p>Leman has issued a statement in which he categorically denies any wrongdoing:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/ellen-degeneres-accepts-720x1024.jpg><p>“I started at the Ellen Show as a PA more than 17 years ago and have devoted my career to work my way to the position I now hold,” he wrote.</p><p>“While my job as head writer is to come up with jokes – and, during that process, we can occasionally push the envelope.”</p><p>“I’m horrified that some of my attempts at humor may have caused offense,” Leman continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/ellen-degeneres-accepts-720x1024.jpg><p>“I have always aimed to treat everyone on the staff with kindness, inclusivity and respect,” he added.</p><p>“In my whole time on the show, to my knowledge, I’ve never had a single HR or inter-personal complaint made about me.”</p><p>“I am devastated beyond belief that this kind of malicious and misleading article could be published.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Leman, of course, is not the only top-level staffer at Ellen’s show to be accused of harassment and inappropriate conduct.</p><p>According to BuzzFeed, numerous former employees claimed that producer Ed Glavin “had a reputation for being handsy with women.”</p><p>And not even discreetly, at that – making you wonder how many people were aware of this and did nothing about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“That was out in the open for everybody to see,” one female employee, told BuzzFeed.</p><p>“You could definitely see the creep factor and the creepy touching.”</p><p>“Obviously, no one wants that and no one wants to be uncomfortably touched by someone … but you didn’t want to piss them off or you would be fired, so it was just that culture of fear.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Employees say they had no one to turn to, as there was no formal process to confidentially file complaints.</p><p>“There was no such thing as a confidential conversation,” a former employee said.</p><p>“There was no clear direction that if something happens to you, you go to this person, it will remain confidential, and you will not be retaliated against.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/ellen-degeneres-accepts-720x1024.jpg><p>As for Ellen’s personal involvement, ex-staffers say there’s zero doubt that she was aware of the behavior and chose to turn a blind eye to it.</p><p>“She knows,” one former employee said. “She knows shit goes on, but also she doesn’t want to hear it.”</p><p>In addition to the investigation that has already resulted in major staff restructuring, Ellen has to contend with another obstacle these days – declining ratings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to a new report from UK tabloid The Sun, ratings for DeGeneres’ talk show have plummeted to record lows, dropping 14 percent in the past two weeks alone.</p><p>It seems that the main driver behind this decline is not the allegations of abuse from Ellen’s staff, but the reports of rudeness and bullying from the 62-year-old host herself.</p><p>Earlier this week, comedian Kevin Porter went viral with a tweet in which he asked his followers to recount incidents in which Ellen had ignored or dismissed them, or otherwise behaved rudely.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/ellen-degeneres-accepts-720x1024.jpg><p>The results of that experiment were not good. Or, at this point, surprising.</p><p>“She’s notoriously one of the meanest people alive,” Porter wrote.</p><p>“Is she always nice? No,” one former employee told The Sun.</p><p>“It irritates me that people think she’s all sweetness and light and she gets away with it.”</p><p>Well, from the way this situation is developing, it seems she won’t be getting away with it much longer.</p><p>We’ll have further updates on this developing story as more information becomes available.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WEcLHLpZynZZSatKa6xKucrGWklrmsedKhprBllp67orjLsmScmZ6Ysq2xw2aYpqGUYsCmxNSao2agkaeutL%2FMnqVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roman-roads-ancient-britain-still-in-use-today.html><span>←</span><span>Roman Britain map reveals the ancient roads built 2,000 years ago that you still drive on today</span></a>
