You go through men faster than Taylor Swift,” Ginny responds in the episode — a quote that Swift shared on her Twitter account.</p><p>Howey, 31, exclusively revealed to Us Weekly that one of the biggest reasons she was drawn to the show was because of how many women were involved.</p><p>“When I went to do the chemistry read and throughout the audition process,<a href=#> it was all women</a>. I’ve never been in that situation or an audition where the majority of the people in the room are women — let alone, they’re all women,” the Exorcist alum told Us last month. “Everyone from creator, showrunner, executive producer, casting director to the lead [were women]. So that was incredibly empowering and exciting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Taylor-Swift-Calls-Out-Ginny-Georgia-for-Sexist-Joke-2.jpg><p>Swift, who has been kept her relationship with the actor<a href=#>&nbsp;</a>relatively private since they started dating in 2017, <a href=#>was previously linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Calvin Harris</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>.</p><p>In November 2020, the “Exile” songstress revealed that <a href=#>her song “Peace” is a lot about her relationship</a> with the Harriet actor, 30, and the perception of their relationship.</p><p>“‘Peace’ is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you <a href=#>do fall in love and you meet someone</a>, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives,” she told <a href=#><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a> in Rolling Stone at the time. “I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The 10-time Grammy winner later addressed how her relationship has changed her.</p><p>“I think that in knowing him an<a href=#>d being in the relationship I am in now,</a> I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids,” Swift said. “Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture—the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song ‘Peace’ is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWjoa6uv4ygoKemqWK0prvRoKCaZZakv26%2FxLGgrKxdn7yssYyamaitpGK1pr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-ashgari-shirtless-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Ashgari Shirtless Photo - The Hollywood Gossip</span></a>
