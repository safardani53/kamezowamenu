She has officially joined 'RHOC'!</h2><p>On Aug. 1, 2022, it was announced that Taylor would be joining the cast of RHOC — becoming the first housewife to switch franchises, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. She'll make her debut on Season 17, which does not yet have a set premiere date.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Taylor Armstrong (@officialtaylorarmstrong)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taylor’s ex-husband died by suicide in August 2011.</h2><p>Just two months before Season 2 of RHOBH began airing in 2011, Taylor filed for divorce from husband Russell Armstrong after almost six years of marriage. She alleged that he was physically and emotionally abusive to her, claiming she had to undergo reconstructive surgery on her eye after he allegedly hit her in the face.</p><p>"The final punch from Russell came on my 40th birthday when he accused me of sleeping with the Chippendales [dancers]," she revealed on an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah: Where Are They Now?</a> in 2015.</p><p>A month after their split and her domestic violence claims became public, the reality star discovered Russell had died by suicide in his new home. Thankfully, her then 5-year-old <a href=#>daughter Kennedy</a> was in the car with Taylor's assistant.</p><p>"After I found him, I ran into the street where they were parked and I was on the ground and quite hysterical, of course," she recalled on Laura Wasser's podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Divorce Sucks!</a>, in 2019.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Kennedy Armstrong and Taylor Armstrong.</p></figure><p>"Then, all of a sudden, it just occurred to me that [Kennedy] was there. And so we had her nanny come to the end of the street and my assistant drove her down so that the emergency vehicles wouldn’t be any more of a chaotic scene than it already was."</p><p>Though Taylor still brings up Russell from time to time, her now high-school-aged daughter doesn't have very fond memories of her father. "I was saying, 'Do you miss daddy?' And she said, 'No. N-O,'" the 51-year-old admitted in March.</p><p>"And I said, 'Well, I miss him sometimes. Do you remember when we went to Hawaii?' and I was trying to give her some references. She waited for a minute and then she said, 'Mommy, why would you miss a boy that screamed at you all the time?'"</p><p>After Russell’s death, Taylor signed on for one more season of RHOBH before meeting future husband John Bluher.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Taylor Armstrong now?</h2><p>The blond beauty tied the knot with John, who is an attorney, on April 4, 2014.</p><p>"I definitely believe the universe put John in my path for a reason. We were meant to be," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor said</a> at the time. "John loves me for exactly who I am. I just know there will never be enough days with him."</p><p>Before they officially tied the knot, Taylor and John appeared on Season 4 of the VH1 series, Couples Therapy, together.</p><p>In 2015, the author posted a special shout-out to her man <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>. "Happy Birthday to my handsome, loving husband [John]. I love you, cherish you, and respect you deeply. Kennedy & I are so blessed."</p><p>Though Taylor is active on social media, she hasn't shared a photo with John since 2015 (though they do both tweet about each other).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taylor Armstrong and her former 'RHOBH' co-star, Brandi Glanville, starred on 'RHUGT' Season 2.</h2><p>Taylor has appeared on various TV programs in the years since she last appeared on RHOBH, but made her grand return to a Real Housewives-type show when Season 2 of The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip premiered on June 23, 2022.</p><p>The sophomore season centers around eight former housewives, with fellow RHOBH alum Brandi Glanville.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Peacock</span><p>Eva Marcille, Jill Zarin, Taylor Armstrong, Vicki Gunvalson, Phaedra Parks, Dorinda Medley, Tamra Judge, and Brandi Glanville.</p></figure><p>The ladies from the 90210 franchise were joined by Phaedra Parks and Eva Marcille Sterling from RHOA, Vicki Gunvalson and Tamra Judge from RHOC, and Dorinda Medley and Jill Zarin from RHONY.</p><p>The cast filmed the show at Dorinda's infamous Blue Stone Manor in the Berkshires.</p><p>Watch Bravo's The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.
