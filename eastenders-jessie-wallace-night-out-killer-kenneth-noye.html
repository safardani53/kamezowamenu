Seeing Kat Slater swaying along to Elvis beside Kenny Noye was surreal to say the least — not to mention incredibly uncomfortable.”</p><p>It is believed to have been known before Tuesday night’s concert that the notorious criminal would be in the box — owned by City trading group OSTC.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>A source added: “Boxes at the O2 have to be signed off in advance, and names and contact details given. People were aware who else was in attendance and Kenneth was gossiped about in advance — everyone was pretty stunned he was going.”</p><p><a href=#>Noye fatally stabbed cop John Fordham, 43, in 1985</a>, but was acquitted on grounds of self-defence. In 2000, he was jailed for life for <a href=#>murdering electrician Stephen Cameron, 21, during a road rage row in 1996 at Swanley, Kent</a>.</p><p>However, he was freed on lifer’s licence in 2019, and is now believed to be developing properties and living in Kent.</p><p>Cameron’s fiancee <a href=#>Danielle Cable</a>, who was 17 and at the scene when Noye murdered her husband-to-be, is still on witness protection.</p><p>Retired detective superintendent Nick Biddiss, who led the murder investigation, said: “He’s out and about enjoying his life. It doesn’t feel like justice to me.”</p><p>Former Flying Squad detective Barry Phillips added: “Families of Noye’s victims and police officers will be dismayed to learn he is living a celebrity lifestyle given his heinous crimes. Many colleagues believe Noye should have been convicted of John Fordham’s murder. If he had, he’d never have been out at the time he stabbed Stephen to death. It is galling to hear he’s out with celebrities.”</p><p>Noye, jailed in 1986 for his part in the <a href=#>Brink’s Mat bullion robbery</a>, was controversially dramatised on screen earlier this year as a wisecracking wide boy in BBC serial The Gold.</p><p>Ex-detective chief inspector Mick Neville said: “Perhaps Jessie was treated to the chirpy cockney charm which the BBC portrayed him with.</p><p>“They showed him as more of a Del Boy type than a vicious knife-wielding killer. Ms Wallace would do well to stay away from a violent criminal who has brought nothing but misery to the world.”</p><p>&nbsp;Jessie, who has played gobby Kat Slater on the BBC soap on and off for 20 years, was a constable in her first TV role, in The Bill in 1999.</p><p>She has also had her share of run-ins with the police off-screen.</p><p>In June last year she was cautioned for kneeing an officer in the groin during a bust-up outside a club in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.</p><p>Footage obtained by The Sun appeared to show Jessie assaulting him as he tried to calm her down.</p><p>She was hauled into a police van and later expressed her “deep regret”.</p><p>The BBC called her behaviour “unacceptable”. In 2003 she got a three-year road ban for drink-driving.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Last night a spokesman said she did not know Noye, adding: “If he was in the shared public box, it’s a genuine coincidence.”</p><p>Box owners OSTC declined to comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3d1c95c2-6c50-4528-b8f9-a65e67aa4490.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/eastenders-actress-jessie-wallace-arrested-741643288.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">THIEVING AS A CHILD TO KILLING AS AN ADULT</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>By John Lucas</p><p>KENNETH Noye’s career as a criminal saw him rise from child bully to gangster and murderer.</p><p>He was first in trouble aged five, dipping into a till at Woolworths.
