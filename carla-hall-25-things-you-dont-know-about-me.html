I love comfort foods that remind me of family, specifically the recipes passed down to me by my grandmother, who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>3. Any meal shared around the table with good friends and family is a memorable meal.</p><p>4. If I weren’t a chef, I’d be an actor.</p><p>5. The book that’s currently on my nightstand is Knock Knock’s I Can’t Sleep: An Inner Truth Journal.</p><p>6. My favorite TV shows at the moment are The Voice and Netflix’s Criminal: Spain.</p><p>7. I was starstruck when I met <a href=#><strong>Carol Burnett</strong></a>.</p><p>8. My celebrity crush is <a href=#><strong>Seal</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Carla-Hall-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-02.jpg><p>9. I didn’t have posters on my wall growing up; I had artwork.</p><p>10. Aside from puzzles, I like to do coloring books to relax.</p><p>11. My husband [<strong>Matthew Lyons</strong>] and I still do the “hootie hoo” call [made famous when Hall was a contestant on Top Chef].</p><p>12. The best advice I’ve ever received was from my grandmother: “It’s your job to be happy, not rich.”</p><p>13. The first thing I do in the morning is make up my bed.</p><p>14. My wardrobe staples are glasses, <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> and scarves. Another one is a great white blouse and colorful socks and tights. It’s always about the splash of color for me.</p><p>15. My favorite season of Top Chef, besides my own, was season 4 [in Chicago].</p><p>16. If I could have dinner with someone, dead or alive, it would be my great-grandmother, who lived to be 102. I’d ask her about her life and her secret to longevity.</p><p>17. I really want to go to Senegal, and I’d like to visit Australia.</p><p>18. My first job was scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins.</p><p>19. My first car was an orange AMC Gremlin. It was loud. We’d play Mo’ Jamaica Funk [by <strong>Tom Browne</strong>] at the loudest volume riding around Hadley Park [in Nashville] with the trunk up and the windows down.</p><p>20. When I was in Kalamazoo, Michigan, this woman came up to me and said, “Are you Carla from The Chew?” When I said yes, her 6-foot-5 husband started jumping up and down, exclaiming, “I knew it, I knew it!”</p><p>21. I’m afraid of heights.</p><p>22. If I’m indulging in fast food, my order is a hot dog with relish, yellow mustard and ketchup, with french fries and a lemonade.</p><p>23. My go-to workout is 20 minutes of stair steps in whatever building I’m in.</p><p>24. The apps I use most are Maps, Amtrak, LastPass, Instagram and Google Calendar.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. The song I play on repeat is “Green Onions” by Booker T. & the M.G.’s.</p><p>Hall is part of the Alzheimer’s Association’s culinary awareness campaign, <a href=#>Around the Table</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKhrm60wKWjZmplYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6pbvNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqWVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-masters-journalist-dennis-nilsen-book.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Dennis Nilsen biographer Brian Masters and where is he now?</span></a>
