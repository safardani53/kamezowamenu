For the day outdoors, the 79-year-old rocked a casual ensemble that featured a green t-shirt, a blue button-up, and green trousers. Michael accessorized his look with black Nike sneakers, a baseball cap, and black sunglasses. Catherine looked chic in a multi-patterned top and white trousers. She tied her look together with a wide-brim sunhat, sunglasses, and beige sneakers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On the second slide, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscar winner</a> posed inside what appeared to be an ashram. For that snapshot, Michael rocked a bright orange scarf around his neck and opted to wear a beige jacket. He also rocked a bright red bandana around his head on the following slide. Finally, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>longtime couple</a>‘s adventures became even more exciting in the last slide, as Michael shared a silly selfie amid what appeared to be a visit to the jungle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Soon after he shared the photos of his trip with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his wife</a>, she made sure to jump into the comments to react. “We love you,” Catherine penned, along with a red heart emoji. Meanwhile, Michael’s nearly 2 million followers also gushed over the post in comments. “Looks like a great trip ! Please keep sharing,” one admirer begged, while another wrote, “You both look great have fun.” A third fan couldn’t help but swoon over the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>longtime lovebirds</a>. “What a great looking couple. So glad you guys have each other all these years,” the fan commented.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Catherine and her hubby have been married since 2000 and have welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two children</a> together. Their daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Carys Zeta Douglas</strong>, was born in 2003, meanwhile their son,&nbsp;<strong>Dylan Michael Douglas</strong>, was born the same year that his parents tied the knot. The proud dad also welcomed his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eldest son</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Cameron Douglas</strong>, with his first wife,&nbsp;<strong>Diandra Luker</strong>, in 1978. Most recently, Michael took to Instagram to celebrate his 23rd wedding anniversary with a loving tribute to his wife. “Happy 23 and Me, my darling @catherinezetajones! Can’t wait for 24! Happy Anniversary,” he captioned a throwback <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding photo</a>. Meanwhile, the brunette beauty responded in the comments with, “Love you sweetheart, may our dance never end.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5ByZqahk52upriMnaaun5yWwG6tzZ1knJmknbKztc2eZLOdpJZ6q7vNnqpmq5iWv6Z50ZqpnmWmlrCiwMiopWaomKTBsL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khloe-kardashian-long-legs-miniskirt-bodysuit-boob-job-plans.html><span>←</span><span>Khloe Kardashian flaunts her long legs in leather miniskirt and busts out of bodysuit after revealin</span></a>
