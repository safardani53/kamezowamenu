The hate that she received was so bad that she deleted the photo, but she eventually put it back up.</p><p>Because screw the hater.</p><p>Here are the things that the trolls attacked her for:</p><p>-looking too thin, even though her waist looks fine (more on that later)</p><p>-"smoking a cigarette" even though she’s smoking a joint</p><p>-using a filter for her photos</p><p>Yeah, that’s a "damning" list of accusations they’ve got there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Chloe has struggled in the past with eating disorders, and she’s been very forthright about her experience.</p><p>So attacking her for "looking sickly" — she looks thin, but she’s also sucking in her gut like everyone in the world when they get their pictures taken.</p><p>The fact that her boobs are decidedly on the large side definitely makes her look slimmer than she is.</p><p>And even if she weren’t at a healthy weight, that would be no reason to attack — or unfollow — her.</p><p>If she were smoking a cigarette, we’d have to agree that it’s gross.</p><p>Cigarettes smell bad and are a plague to everyone around you.</p><p>More significantly for Chloe, like, her mom has cancer, cigarettes are a carcinogen … that wouldn’t be a great combination. Bad optics.</p><p>But she’s smoking a joint, which is plenty legal in a lot of places and also the opposite of a carcinogen.</p><p>In fact, we’re pretty sure that breast cancer is one of the specific types of cancer that marijuana has been shown to reduce the risk of.</p><p>And then … somebody attacked her for using filters on her photos?</p><p>That is the most random troll attack we’ve seen since the 2016 elections.</p><p>That one doesn’t need explaining. It’s a filter. Chill out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Shortly after her mother’s <a href=#>breast cancer diagnosis</a> was made public, Chloe was attacked over her photos — for living her life.</p><p>Specifically, we guess, for smiling.</p><p>Chloe just wants to live her life, but apparently some hate-filled commenters think that, since her mom is undergoing cancer treatment, she should either never post to social media … or post nothing but some sort of grief montage.</p><p>Those jerks need to chill out.</p><p>Everybody grieves in their own way.</p><p>But also, Olivia Newton-John has scarcely begun her treatment.</p><p>It’s not time to grieve, period.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We think that we know what’s going on with these trolls.</p><p>First of all, there’s the regular bullying motive — they see someone who in some way doesn’t fit their expectations or desires.</p><p>And they perceive her as vulnerable, so they lash out.</p><p>But part of cyberbullying&nbsp;functions just like … have you ever noticed that certain people, whether they’re aggressive soccer moms or bitter retirees, seem to go into grocery stores looking to pick fights. They’ll complain to a manager about an innocuous employee.</p><p>It makes them feel like they’ve done something for the day and it makes them feel powerful and reassured about their place in the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ultimately, hateful comments aren’t going away any time soon.</p><p>Every time that someone asks Twitter to do something about the harassment problem (or the nazis), they nod and then just change the illustrations for retweets.</p><p>Finding a way to ignore them without changing the way that you live your life or post to social media is key.</p><p>Chloe Lattanzi’s made her Instagram private, which is better than swearing off social media altogether, and she still has tens of thousands of followers.</p><p>Because if your online life is making you suffer in real life on a regular basis, then you need to find a way to keep it from touching you.</p><p>And one day, maybe society can fix whatever the hell is so wrong with us that makes people send hateful messages to celebrities in the first place.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WDcK%2FHpaaeZZyWwbWtzbOgZqecnsOqrYynnLCsn6N6q7vHp6pmnJGqtKnAxKtkmqyklrCsscNmmbJlpKe8rbjSZqZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-b-jordan-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Michael B.
