While Dr. Justine De Young of the Fashion Institute of Technology told PEOPLE the move was "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>irresponsible and unnecessary</a>," Monroe's estate supported Kardashian, with Nick Woodhouse of Authentic Brand Groups (the company in charge of the estate) saying that Monroe would've celebrated the reality star's choice of wardrobe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to revisit all of the other incredible fashion moments Marilyn Monroe created over the years.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Marilyn Monroe at her wedding to James Dougherty</strong> in <strong>1942</strong></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sunset Boulevard/Corbis</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her wedding to neighbor James Dougherty, Monroe, then 16 and known as Norma Jeane Mortenson, chose a simple streamlined gown with ruched sleeves and a modest scoop neckline. The couple, who were wed for four years, married at the suggestion of Monroe's foster mother to avoid sending her back to the orphanage, according to Dougherty. As he later told United Press International in 1990, per the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>, "I never knew Marilyn Monroe, and I don't claim to have any insights to her to this day.

She stood in the grass in a floor-length robin's egg blue frock with floral embroidering at the bust, sleeves and skirt.

"Apart from the two side seams, the dress was folded into shape rather like cardboard. Any other girl would have looked like she was wearing cardboard, but on screen I swear you would have thought Marilyn had on a pale, thin piece of silk. Her body was so fabulous it still came through," he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travilla accessorized the famous dress with a pair of matching opera-length gloves. As for the oversized bow at the back, it was stuffed with horse hair to help it maintain its shape.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in 1953</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sunset Boulevard/Corbis</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travilla was also behind the sexy gold lamé getup Monroe was briefly spotted in during Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The halter-style design featured a plunging neckline and sunburst pleating with an open back. It was also skintight, with Monroe reportedly needing to be sewn into it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress later wore it to the Photoplay Gold Medal awards dinner, where she took home the award for most popular female star.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in 1953</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sunset Boulevard/Corbis</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the pink dress from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is the one most-oft referenced, the orange fishtail gown Travilla created for the film is also memorable. With ruching down the front and a beaded center, the dress is said to have caused theater-goers to gasp when the actress appeared in it alongside costar Jane Russell, who looked equally radiant in her own beaded black sequin gown.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in 1953</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>20th Century-Fox/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The matching wedding dresses that Monroe and Russell wore in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes were far more dramatic than any of the dresses the blonde bombshell wore for her real-life nuptials to Dougherty, Joe DiMaggio and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Arthur Miller</a>. Designed by Travilla, they featured a mock neck, a sheer lace bodice with voluminous bell sleeves and a pleated tulle skirt. They also buttoned halfway up the back.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Marilyn Monroe at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1953</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>M.

Though both gowns were cut to the mid-calf, Monroe's featured eyelet detailing throughout while Russell's had a polka dot print.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Marilyn and I were invited to add our footprints to those already cemented in at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard.

We were thrilled beyond words," Russell later remembered of the moment in her eponymous autobiography.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire in 1953</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sunset Boulevard/Corbis</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even the swimwear for How to Marry a Millionaire, which was designed by Travilla under Charles LaMeire, looked couture.

Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in New York ahead of his 45th birthday on May 19, 1962.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-208 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sketched by Bob Mackie at the age of 22 and crafted by Jean Louis, the sheer beige number featured 2,500 hand-sewn crystals. The custom piece was so form-fitting that Monroe reportedly had to be sewn into it. She also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>forwent undergarments</a> despite the 18-inch slit in the back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-210 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The gown was first sold at a Christie's auction in 1999 for a cool $1.27 million. In 2015, however, it was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>purchased by Ripley's Believe It Or Not for a record-breaking</a> $4.81 million. The figure beat the previous record of $4.6 million set by another item of Monroe's: the pleated dress she so famously wore for The Seven Year Itch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-212 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kardashian <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>borrowed the gown</a> for the 2022 Met Gala, which had a theme of "In America: An Anthology of Fashion," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wearing it on the steps of the Met</a> before changing into a replica. As she relayed to Vogue, "Nowadays everyone wears sheer dresses, but back then that was not the case. In a sense, it's the original naked dress. That's why it was so shocking."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqaYq6Gcrrtuuc6nqaidXZeytMCMn5isoJmku265zqacp6yjYrynecClo2asmaKycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jao-romanias-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Jao Romanias Girlfriend: Who is Jao Romania Dating?</span></a>
