However, they posed for pictures together as part of Gucci’s luggage campaign, looking happy and cozy in the joint photo shoot.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Over the summer, Kendall opened up about how she views romance, noting that she normally wants to “fight for relationships” rather than just give up on someone.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I love really hard, and I love without apology,” the 818 Tequila founder told <i>Harper Bazaar</i> in August 2023. “I don’t like goodbyes, and I will fight to not have to say ‘goodbye.’ I will always fight for relationships. I’ve been that way since I was little, although I was shy and sometimes very closed off. I don’t give up on anything. Some people aren’t willing to meet me at that level. But that’s OK. I’d rather do that than shut myself off to something and not give it a proper chance.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>One month before their reported split, Kendall <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sparked breakup rumors</a> that November by posting what fans thought was cryptic Instagram caption, which read, “What’s meant for me will simply find me.” However, this wasn’t the first time that the reality TV star has said this. Many recalled Kendall saying this exact phrase during her summer 2023 Calvin Klein campaign during a promotional ad for the brand.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49sZqSdnpmurbiMo5ynppWneqK6w2aZmpxdl8KvuthmqZ6tnp7BpnnIp2SbmaKXrqW70maYn6yVp3qjvsSaoq6oXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jhbteam-20020617-html.html><span>←</span><span>JhbTeam (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
