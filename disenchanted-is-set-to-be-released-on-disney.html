The planned musical is a sequel to 2007 hit Enchanted. The narrative for the new film was developed by a group of highly recognized authors, including J. David Stem, David N. Weiss, and Richard LaGravenese. Disenchanted’s script was written by Brigitte Hales, and the film was directed by acclaimed musical theater artist Adam Shankman.</p><p>The Disney Plus film’s cameraman was Simon Duggan, while the music was composed by Alan Menken, a well-known musician. Barry Sonnenfeld, Barry Josephson, and Amy Adams are producing the film.&nbsp;Musical fans have been anxious to see how the rom-com fantasy musical Disenchanted will evolve since Disney+ released the initial teaser. Without further ado, let’s dig right in to learn all there is to know about Disenchanted before it hits Disney+.</p><h2>Learn all there is to know about Disenchanted before it premieres on Disney Plus.</h2><p>The romantic comedy musical will be launched on the famous streaming service platform Disney + on Friday, November 18, 2022. The new film will be broadcast at 3 a.m. ET/12 a.m. PT. The sequel to Enchanted takes place 15 years after the marriage of Giselle and Robert Philip. In the film, the two are shown traveling from Manhattan to the suburb of Monroeville with their teenage daughter Morgan. They relocated to the tranquil suburban town due to Giselle’s increasing dissatisfaction with their life in the metropolis.</p><p>The official description for the film, published with the official trailer by Disney Plus, reads:</p><p>“It’s been almost 10 years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) married, but Giselle has become disillusioned with city life, so they relocate their expanding family to the tranquil suburban village of Monroeville in quest of a more fairy tale living.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Disenchanted-1.jpg alt=Disenchanted width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It goes on:</p><p>“It isn’t, however, the rapid remedy she had hoped for. Suburbia has its own set of regulations, as well as a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel even more out of place.”</p><p>According to the narrative, she is dissatisfied since finding her happily ever after proved difficult. As a result, she “relies on the magic of Andalasia for assistance.” However, she unintentionally turns their whole village into a “real-life fairy tale,” jeopardizing her family’s happiness. It continues:</p><p>“Now, Giselle is racing against the clock to break the enchantment and discover what happily ever after actually means to her and her family.”</p><p>It is obvious that the change will be difficult for Giselle and her family as they adjust to their new suburban environment and magic.</p><h2>What do you think of the official trailer for the fresh new Disney Plus sequel musical?</h2><p>Take a look at the official Disney Plus trailer for the film, which was released on November 1, 2022:</p><p></p><p>The official teaser teases the viewer with a few tantalizing views of what to anticipate from the film. Giselle and her family seem to be encountering several obstacles as they attempt to integrate into their new Monroeville suburban neighborhood in the trailer.&nbsp;The film also depicts Giselle’s struggle to keep her life together as a result of a fascinating magic spell that transforms the modest village into a fantasy kingdom. It is reasonable to state that the film will transport spectators on an engrossing and thrilling magical journey.</p><h2>Who are the movie’s cast members?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Disenchanted-2.jpg alt=Disenchanted width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Amy Adams plays Giselle Philip, Patrick Dempsey plays Robert Philip, Idina Menzel plays Nancy Tremaine, James Marsden plays King Edward, Maya Rudolph plays Malvina Monroe, Yvette Nicole Brown plays Rosaleen, Gabriella Baldacchino plays Morgan Philip, and Jayma Mays plays Ruby, among others.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Disenchanted</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiboquVo7Cprc2tnJ1lmah6tLHTZquoZZKaerOxy56YrJ2UYryvecOiqqedqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alison-van-uytvanck.html><span>←</span><span>Alison Van Uytvanck- Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating</span></a>
