We went straight over there and the girl was dead and the mother was cradling her in her arms and screaming.</p><p>"Adrian was shouting as well – injured but conscious – but the mother understood it was too late for her daughter.

I don't understand," he said, after judges confirmed a test showed he was "on drugs" on Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking at a press conference on Monday, public prosecutor Camille Miansoni said Raats did not mean to shot Solaine.</p><p>He said: "It would seem that he was not aiming at the little girl."</p><p>The court heard that Raats had worked as a photographer, shepherd and carer for the handicapped before retiring to France some five years ago.</p><p>Anne Guillerme, his defence barrister, said he had "no criminal record" and may have psychiatric problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Raats was remanded in custody following the charges, and could spend the rest of his life in prison if found guilty at trial.</p><p>Raats’ wife&nbsp;Marlene van Hook, also in her 70s, was meanwhile&nbsp;being questioned on suspicion of concealing a weapon.</p><p>Both Raats and his wife "tested positive for alcohol and cannabis" at the time of their arrest, said Miansoni.</p><p>He told a press conference held in Brest on Monday evening that the crimes were linked to "an old neighbour dispute".</p><p>And he said that Raats had "blamed his neighbours for noise pollution".</p><p>Mayor Marguerite Bleuzen said: "We knew the family well. There is a village fête every year and they always came.</p><p>"It is incomprehensible to have shot a child. No one can understand how that could have happened."</p><p>Raats is believed to have become fixated on the Thorntons.</p><p>He was furious they had cleared the land of oak trees to install play equipment including swings.&nbsp;</p><p>Arguments first reached boiling point around three years ago, when Raats complained that his privacy was threatened, and so pointed a weapon at the Thorntons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/f9535c97-4540-4413-abf0-ad1e034db975.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6f4da14c-f6af-4e78-a676-a4b51f7b10de.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brit-girl-11-shot-dead-824466376.jpg><p>Marguerite Bleuzen, Mayor of&nbsp;Plonévez-du-Faou, which covers&nbsp;Saint-Herbot, confirmed there had been "some trouble with a neighbour dispute" between the two families since at least 2020.</p><p>"I intervened with my deputies when we were elected," she said.</p><p>"There was a problem with the land around their properties, and with noise pollution – it started from there."</p><p>Following the official intervention three years ago, there had been "no emergency," but Ms Bleuzen was aware that arguments continued to simmer.&nbsp;</p><p>"This morning, tongues are loosening,’ she said. ‘I think they&nbsp;all&nbsp;had a little trouble getting on with each other."</p><p>Ms&nbsp;Bleuzen&nbsp;added:&nbsp;"The family was well known and liked. There is a village fête every year and they always came.</p><p>"It’s&nbsp;incomprehensible to have shot a child. No one can understand how that could have happened."</p><p>Raats first threatened the family with a .22 hunting rifle as far back as 2020, according to neighbours in the hamlet.</p><p>One said: "That’s what the dispute three years ago was&nbsp;all&nbsp;about – police were called because he was threatening the family with his rifle.</p><p>"The two families were always arguing, and the rifle escalated matters, but nobody ever believed that he would use it."</p><p>The weapon was a licensed hunting rifle, and no effort was made to confiscate it by the police, or council officials.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Thornton remained "critical with life-threatening wounds" on Monday, while his wife was also in intensive care at the Cavale Blanche&nbsp;hospital in Brest, where they both underwent surgery.</p><p>All&nbsp;of the Thorntons were in the garden of their property – a converted sawmill – when shots were fired at around 9pm on Saturday.</p><p>The Thorntons had lived in the property – a converted sawmill close to Saint-Herbot chapel – for around five years.</p><p>Raats&nbsp;lived in a neighbouring converted schoolhouse with his wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Thornton was well known around the hamlet and surrounding countryside for helping out with DIY tasks, while Mrs Thornton was a home help.</p><p>Celeste&nbsp;Thornton raised the alarm after seeing "all&nbsp;her family members shot in the head," said another investigating source.&nbsp;</p><p>She was with her sister on garden swings when the attack happened, while their parents were tending the barbecue.&nbsp;</p><p>Officers from the GIGN&nbsp;– the&nbsp;Gendarme National Intervention Group&nbsp;–&nbsp;arrived to support local police.</p><p>"The shooter locked himself in his home after the shooting so there was a brief siege," said the source.</p><p>"After some negotiation, the suspect gave himself up without a struggle, and he was arrested, alongside his wife.
