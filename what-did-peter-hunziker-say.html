So, what did Peter Hunziker say that put him in this position?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Peter Hunziker has been fired from 'Below Deck'.</h2><p>On June 17, Bravo announced they were firing Peter Hunziker from Below Deck, effectively immediately. In a post on Instagram, the company wrote, “Peter Hunziker of Below Deck Mediterranean has been terminated for his racist post,” the network announced. “Bravo and 51 Minds are editing the show to minimize his appearance for subsequent episodes.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)</a> on Jun 17, 2020 at 9:29am PDT</p></figure><p>The deckhand appeared in three episodes, so far, of Season 5, which premiered earlier this month. The show is currently in post-production, so edits will be made moving forward to ensure Peter's presence is as limited as possible.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Peter Hunziker say that got him fired?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMail</a>, Peter posted an Instagram Story that was brought to the attention of Bravo and it resulted in his termination. DailyMail says the post in question "appeared to be a reposted meme that depicted shocking racist and degrading sexual imagery that showed a naked Black woman in shackles."&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that description, the network nor the media company shared further details about the post in question. The site also says that the reality TV deckhand was on thin ice after referring to Malia White, his boss, as a "sweetheart" or "sweetie" in a recent episode, which Captain Sandy reprimanded him for during the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Peter Hunziker is one of many reality TV stars fired lately.</h2><p>At the time of this post, Peter hasn't made a statement on his firing or the racist and sexist post in question. However, his firing comes on the heels of several other Bravo reality TV stars – including Stassi Schroeder, Max Boyens, Kristen Doute, and Brett Caprioni — being let go for racially-charged comments that have surfaced.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So far, <a href=#>@BravoTV</a> has fired Stassi Schroeder, Kristen Doute, Max Boyens, Brett Caprioni, and Peter Hunziker for racist behavior...who do you think should be next? <a href=#>#PumpRules</a> <a href=#>#BelowDeck</a> <a href=#>#bravotv</a> <a href=#>#fired</a></p>— Anita K (@Heffa_K) <a href=#>June 17, 2020</a></figure><p>MTV has also recently cut ties with several members of their reality shows, including Dee Nguyen, Alex Kompothecras, and Taylor Selfridge, after similar comments came to light.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@bravotv announces that they have fired @peterhunz after discovering a racist post on his social media. #belowdeck #belowdeckmed #belowdeckmediterranean #mediterranean</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Below Deck Mediterranean</a> (@belowdeckmedbravo) on Jun 17, 2020 at 10:02am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans seem to support Bravo firing Peter Hunziker.</h2><p>In the comment section of the post made by Bravo on Instagram, the network has received hundreds of comments commending the network for taking swift action.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why does this not surprise me? 3 episodes in and the guy creeped me out with the way he talked about women," one person commented. &nbsp;</p><p>"@maliakpwhite so proud of you for sticking up for yourself against his sexist comments!" another commenter said. "For you and for all women! @hannahferrier234 we love to see two women in charge of the deck and interior. Can’t wait to see you two boss it up some more this season."&nbsp;</p><p>Several other comments are calling on Bravo to take a closer look at Jax Taylor, with one person writing, "What about JAX TAYLOR?!?! He’s the worst one on your network and you keep standing by him and Brittany WHY?"&nbsp;</p><p>The current season of Below Deck Mediterranean takes place in Spain and airs weekly on Bravo on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p><strong>If you are looking for ways to donate your time or money to Black Lives Matter and other antiracist organizations, we have created a&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>list of resources</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to get you started.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1loJrBpr6MoaynspmgsrN50pqw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./soupachu.html><span>←</span><span>soupachu- Age, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career, Nationality</span></a>
