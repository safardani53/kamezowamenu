Her jolly personality and raw talent have attracted fans worldwide as she continues to be a well-respected celeb. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>DeLaria, nicknamed as ‘Butch,’ is perhaps best known for her&nbsp;Orange Is The New Black&nbsp;role as Big Boo, but that’s not all there is to her acting and comedy career. She&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started&nbsp;</a>with small stand-up comedies back in the 1980s and gradually moved on to bigger stages.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 1993,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she hosted</a>&nbsp;Comedy Central’s&nbsp;Out There, bringing her into mainstream media. Since then, she has been<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;cast for</a>&nbsp;several TV series and movies, including&nbsp;Baroness von Sketch Show,&nbsp;Law and Order,&nbsp;Friends, and, most recently,&nbsp;Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The ‘Butch’ is Also an Amazing Jazz Singer</h2><p>DeLaria’s success in the comedy and the acting industry seems to overshadow her lesser-known image as a jazz singer. Even so, her musical career is by no means unsuccessful. She has released multiple albums and done shows all&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">around the US</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the world</a>. Some of her albums include<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;</a>Double Standards,&nbsp;Play it cool, and&nbsp;Be a Santa—you can buy them on Amazon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>DeLaria has also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>&nbsp;that her musical background helped quite a lot to score extra points during early stand-ups.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>…I incorporated jazz into my standup…and it worked like a charm.</p><h2>Lea DeLaria is a Millionaire</h2><p>DeLaria’s career success has certainly paid off well. She has a fortune of over a million dollars; celebritynetworth.com&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimates it</a>&nbsp;at $1.5 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Her price tag&nbsp;</a>for doing events might be in line with her net worth too. If you want to call her for a performance, you will have to pay at least $15,000 -25,000 inside the United States alone. That number is significantly high even by celebrity standards.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But Lea DeLaria Doesn’t lead a Flashy Life</h2><p>Considering all the money she has, DeLaria’s lifestyle is surprisingly moderate. She lives in a working-class neighborhood around Bushwick, Brooklyn, and leads a simple life. She seems to like places with good music, nothing over the top, just local restaurants.</p><p>In an interview with<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Bushwickdaily</a>, when asked about where hangs out when she is outside, DeLaria had rather simple places in her mind.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"...Either under elevated track of the M/J line or the outdoor patio at Mominette," she said.</p><p>All in all, her lifestyle does not reflect the net worth of the actress; she pretty much lives like an everyday person.</p><h2>Still, DeLaria is Quite Fond of Automobiles</h2><p>There is a quirk to Lea DeLaria’s simple life, though; she seems to be an automobile enthusiast.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Her Instagram</a>&nbsp;showcases several pictures of her trips to garages and test drives. She also has pictures of cars and bikes with captions that seem like she knows her stuff about the automobile industry.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6GyonnDnqOaqpmWeq%2Bx02auqKqknXupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ink-master.html><span>←</span><span>Ink Master Season 8 Episodes</span></a>
