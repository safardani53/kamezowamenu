I still pretty much cry every day. It’s growing pains,” she said in April 2021.</p><p class=p1>The fitness instructor added that she’s “doing everything I possibly can to stay healthy and active and happy. And you know, grief is a process … Everybody does it differently.”</p><p class=p1>The former professional dancer revealed that <a href=#>Elvis’s new milestones</a> make her grief process more difficult. “With Elvis, like, there’s so many things that he does or there’s times in life that you just wish your person was there to celebrate with,” she explained. “And I think that&nbsp;that’s where it’s harder&nbsp;because you miss your person so much.”</p><p class=p1>Kloots&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s1>hosted a memorial</span></a>&nbsp;for her husband in July 2020 for the couple’s <a href=#>family and close friends</a>.

She continued, via her Instagram: “Truly, I am scared. Scared of my new normal, of the pain, the loss and being strong enough to get through it. But, I know Nick is up above rooting [sic] for me, believing in me and hoping for me.”</p><p class=p1>Cordero was first admitted to the hospital in March 2020 after experiencing <a href=#>symptoms of COVID-19</a>.
