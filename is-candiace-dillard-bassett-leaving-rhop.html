Her succinct reads and impeccable vocabulary can bring even the toughest ‘Wife to tears. And when it’s time for Candiace to shed a tear, you know she will do so with her iconic “cry-angle” napkin fold.</p><p>As endearing as it’s been to watch Candiace on our screens for years, every Housewives star faces the moment they must <a href=#>hang up their wine glass</a> and remove the cameras from their personal lives. Since RHOP returned for its eighth season in November 2023, Candiace has hinted she could become a former reality TV star sooner rather than later.</p><p>Here’s everything Candiace has said about how long she plans on staying on RHOP.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Candiace Dillard Bassett leaving ‘The Real Housewives of Potomac?’</h2><p>RHOP returned to Bravo for Season 8 on Nov. 5, 2023. Many fans noticed this season that Candiace, known to get into an altercation or two, kept her distance around her friend group during the season. Candiace has even said she considers <a href=#>Wendy Osefo</a> her only authentic friend in the cast.</p><p>With Candiace staying out of the drama in Season 8, fans became concerned the season would be her last. In December 2023, Candiace admitted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> that she was stepping back from getting into the drama but wasn’t planning on leaving Potomac for good.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chazitear Martin (@chazitear)</a></p></figure><p>However, the “Drive Back” singer said she has an “exit strategy” for reality TV in her purview. She has already been focused on her ventures outside of Bravo, including her music and a starring role on the AllBLK Network’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hush</a>.</p><p>"I have always had a plan," Candiace explained about her future on RHOP. "Everything is a gift. All of this, like the music, the acting, Potomac -- it's all a bonus for me. None of it is something that I feel entitled to, and I would rather live that way than the other way."</p><p>In January 2023, Candiace made similar sentiments when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> asked her about her time on RHOP, making it clear that she would know when it was time.</p><p>“I’m here until I’m not or until they fire me,” she explained.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Candiace Dillard Bassett has a history of not getting along with her ‘RHOP’ co-stars.</h2><p>Although she’s not an OG, Candiace has become synonymous with RHOP during her time on the show. She has been at the center of several of the series’ scandals, including her epic fight with her former co-star, <a href=#>Monique Samuels</a>, and her Season 7 beef with <a href=#>Gizelle Bryant</a> that has continued into Season 8.</p><p>In Season 7, Gizelle claimed Candiace’s husband, <a href=#>Chris Bassett</a>, made Gizelle feel uncomfortable during the taping of the RHOP Season 6 reunion. The accusation caused Candiace and Gizelle’s friendship to dissolve and, consequently, Candiace’s friendship with Gizelle’s BFF, <a href=#>Robyn Dixon</a>. Candiace and Robyn also came to blows after Candiace tweeted her disappointment in Robyn for not disclosing her marital issues with her husband, <a href=#>Juan Dixon</a>, on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“If you would just shut the f–-k up and worry about your boyfriends for hire and cheating husbands, you wouldn’t have to post ‘proof’ that you weren’t behind yet another plot against someone’s family,” Candiace said in October 2023, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. “Once again, the people of God are tired.”</p><p><strong>I</strong>n her interview with ET, Candiace said she would be willing to turn over a new leaf with Gizelle and Robyn, significantly shifting the current dynamics within the cast. However, Candiace said she wouldn’t do so without an apology from her co-stars and former pals.</p><p>“I mean, I'm probably crazy — I'm still optimistic that people could come to their senses," Candiace admitted. "But I'm also prepared to move around in the event that they're not, but I will also make clear, what I will not do is pretend like I'm not owed an apology and like I'm not owed humanity from people who want to be inhumane."</p><p>Fortunately, fans will have plenty of time to see what unfolds between Candiace and her castmates since we will have more of the multitalented Bravolebrity in future RHOP seasons!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur8Cnm6KZk5p6pbXLpZirnF2XrrS%2FxK2rZqSVlsOqusZmqaGnoA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./archie-panjabi-reacts-to-good-wife-bar-scene-with-julianna-margulies.html><span>←</span><span>Archie Panjabi Reacts to Good Wife Bar Scene With Julianna Margulies</span></a>
