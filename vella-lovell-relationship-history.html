After all, there's a reason Vella's characters are so often fan-favorites — from the sarcastic Heather Davis in <a href=#>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</a> to the social-media-savvy Mikaela Shaw in <a href=#>Mr. Mayor</a>. The naturally funny and engaging actor has fans curious to know more about her.</p><p>Below, we take a look at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Animal Control</a> star's career and personal life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Vella Lovell? What is her relationship history like?</h2><p>California-born, New Mexico–raised Vella had plans of becoming a pianist (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's classically trained</a>) before eventually switching lanes to follow her passions in musical theater. She got her bachelor's from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts and hustled for a while in the downtown NYC theater scene before eventually graduating from Juilliard in 2015 and getting her big break that same year on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.</p><p>She also voiced Princess Mermista in Netflix's <a href=#>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a> and has appeared in films like The Big Sick and <a href=#>Your Place or Mine</a>, as well as shows like Girls and <a href=#>Dollface</a>.</p><p>These days, you can catch her on the new Fox comedy Animal Control alongside <a href=#>Joel McHale</a>, about "local animal control workers [who] find humans to be the most complicated part of their lives."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>We like Vella a lot, so we decided to do a deep dive into her Instagram for information on her relationship history. Do we feel like creepy stalkers? Absolutely. But did we find some info? Yes. Yes, we did.</p><p>Based on social media, it looks like Vella dated actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Braun</a> from around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2016</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2017</a>, and then began seeing actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Garet Stoker</a> sometime around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a>. It appears that she and John are still together today.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@vellalovell</a><p>We appreciate that Vella's dudes take her on theater dates!

"There is no 'arriving,' 'figuring it all out,' or 'solving the puzzle.' That being said, I think every day I know myself a bit more and the statue that I’m carving becomes a little more clear, as opposed to the lump of clay when I first started out."</p><p>"I have become more sure that in my personal life I am striving for kindness, honesty, and compassion to myself and others," she added, "and that in my professional life I want to lift up people and storytellers who value humanity and equity, and are as authentic and diverse as the world around me."</p><p>You can catch Vella on Animal Control Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on Fox.</p><p><a href=#>'Celebrity Beef' Host Joel McHale and His Wife Met and Married Within a Year</a></p><p><a href=#>Actor and Writer Rachel Bloom's Husband Definitely Understands and Supports Her Career</a></p><p><a href=#>Yes, 'Your Place or Mine' Star Wesley Kimmel Is Related to Jimmy Kimmel</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq7KtuMBmo6iulaG5br7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2afoqukpL%2B6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-michael-copon-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Michael Copon Dating Now</span></a>
