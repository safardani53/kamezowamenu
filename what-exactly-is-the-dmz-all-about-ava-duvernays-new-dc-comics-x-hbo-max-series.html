<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>What Exactly Is The DMZ? All About Ava DuVernays New DC Comics X HBO Max Series</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span><strong>On March 8, HBO Max released the first trailer for the live-action miniseries DMZ</strong>, based on Brian Wood’s graphic novel of the same name. The series, developed by Roberto Patino, features Ava DuVernay, Rosario Dawson, Benjamin Bratt, and others.</span></p><p><span>Following in the footsteps of past DC efforts such as The CW’s Naomi, DuVernay, and Roberto Patino have collaborated with Array Filmworks and Warner Bros. Television to bring the miniseries to HBO Max on March 17, 2022.</span></p><p><span>According to the IMDb profile, Ava DuVernay will also direct the opening episode of the four-part miniseries. The remaining episodes will be led by Ernest R. Dickerson, well-known for her work on many episodes of The Walking Dead.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ava-duvernay-directing-dmz-adaptation-hbo-max.jpg><h2>What is the story of the DMZ comic book?</h2><p><span>The comic series was written by Brian Wood and illustrated by Wood and Riccardo Burchielli. It debuted in January 2006 under DC’s Vertigo imprint and was last published in early 2012.</span></p><p><span>Following the comic’s footsteps, the HBO Max miniseries will take place in a dystopian future. According to the comics, a second Civil War erupted in the United States, leaving Manhattan, New York City, as a demilitarized zone (or DMZ).</span></p><p><span>The island of Manhattan is caught in the crossfire of the country’s post-second civil war between two groups of authority. The federal government of the United States of America and the military of the Free States of America are the two factions.</span></p><p><span>Thus, the DMZ comic series deals with militia revolts, riots, escalating power disputes, and corruption, among other things.</span></p><h2>Will the HBO Max series be based on the DMZ comics?</h2><p><span>While the comic series follows photojournalist Matty Roth’s adventure, the four-episode miniseries will follow the story of a medic, Alma. In the comics, Roth becomes stranded on the island after becoming disoriented and decides to remain in the demilitarized zone.</span></p><p><span>He infiltrates terrorist organizations in the second issue of the first book. Furthermore, by the end of the series, the character has amassed great power and influence over the DMZ.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, the series follows Alma (Rosario Dawson) as she searches the island for her missing son. Similarly, in the film, Benjamin Bratt will play Parco Delgado, a gang leader. According to TVLine, Delgado’s attempts to seize control of the island will also be shown in the series.</span></p><p><span>The series creator, Roberto Patino, who previously worked on Westworld, said in a recent statement:</span></p><p><span>“The DMZ provides an explosive playground that, above all, extols the tenacity of the community and the human spirit.” I can’t wait to welcome both long-time comic book aficionados and new viewers to this enthralling, disturbing, and inspiring universe.”</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZmkYrK5rcKto7Jlmah6tbTEZpumsl2Wua15wJumrqxdlsOiecOurZ6qnpbGtHnNnq5mnJNisLC5yJyqZrBdna%2Bwecyar2arlae2pr%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-squishmallows-7101144.html><span>←</span><span>The 19 Most Popular Squishmallows of 2024</span></a>
