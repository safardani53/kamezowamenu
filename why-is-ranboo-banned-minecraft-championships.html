We'll explain.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Ranboo banned from the Minecraft Championships?</h2><p>Ranboo isn't actually banned from MCC, but was jokingly "banned" after Smajor, who's the organizer of MCC, said "Can we ban Ranboo from everything? I think it's only fair at this point," during Tubbo's stream chat ‚Äî but it was completely as a joke.&nbsp;</p><p>Ranboo had emailed the MCC saying "I have clout, please" after he tweeted, "600 retweets and I'll email @MCChampionship_ the words 'I have clout. Please.'"&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>https://t.co/ZylXyQ6z2a</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nriB7AUrSt</a></p>‚Äî Ranboo (@Ranboosaysstuff) <a href=#>October 22, 2020</a></figure><p>MCC responded on Twitter, saying, "Hi Ranboo, Thank you for your email...

Kind regards, Ranboo." Seemingly, this was all in good fun.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hello MCC,</p><p>I am very confused.</p><p>Am I banned?</p><p>Kind regards,<br>Ranboo ü§†</p>‚Äî Ranboo (@Ranboosaysstuff) <a href=#>October 23, 2020</a></figure><p>According to one redditor, Ranboo's letter to MCC was actually "the nicest letter they had received so far," sharing, "Yeah also in the admin stream for MCC 11 noxcrew actually talked about ranboo's letter for consideration. Apparently it was a bit longer than what he had shown in his tweet, and the admins stated it was actually the nicest letter they had recieved [sic] so far. So yeah the back and forth exchange is all in good fun lol."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Another redditor confirmed that Ranboo getting "banned" was just a joke.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>If you go on Twitter, you'll see fans who are trying to clear up the "rumor" that Ranboo is banned. "!!! GUYS RANBOO ISNT ACTUALLY BANNED FROM MCC ITS AN ONGOING JOKE !!!" one person wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>!!!

After Tubbo blocked him, Ranboo tweeted, "I would apologize to tubbo on here but HE WONT BE ABLE TO SEE IT."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I would apologize to tubbo on here but HE WONT BE ABLE TO SEE IT</p>‚Äî Ranboo (@Ranboosaysstuff) <a href=#>October 26, 2020</a></figure><p>This was why Ranboo was "blocked."
