If you <a href=#>watch Vanderpump Rules online</a>, you probably already know that Stassi has been trying to change her ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, she’s kind of still causing a lot of trouble for the girls. She always wants to be the center of attention and that’s what is rubbing the others the wrong way.&nbsp;</p><p>Katie was a much better person when Stassi was out of her life, but she’s slowly falling back into the person she was when Stassi was in charge and it’s sad.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/l-to-the-vp-756x1024.jpg><p>Katie then decided to make Lisa aware that she is behind Stassi and that she’s changed for the better.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Katie, Stassi and Kristen Doute wondered whether Scheana Marie would show up for Stassi’s birthday celebration in the Hamptons.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though they were all bickering, it was clear Stassi still wanted her there, but Scheana&nbsp;chatted with Shay about it and worried that she would be disinvited.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe Scheana&nbsp;should just ditch the whole thing. It’s not like anything good ever comes from Stassi’s birthday celebrations. There’s always some sort of fight.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Mike seemed to take Scheana’s side throughout the whole thing by branding the ladies bullies.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Ariana, Tom and Lala&nbsp;went to a DJ gig that James Kennedy was working at. He was still super cut up about being fired from SUR, but was thankful that his friends showed up for him.&nbsp;</p><p>This paved the way for him to go meet Lisa to try and get his job back, but Lisa revealed that there was not a chance in hell that she would employ him again.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>37 Classic Vanderpump Rules Moments in GIFs</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>All of this came about when Lisa took issue with him calling her a liar.&nbsp;</p><p>"You were an arrogant little punk — and look at me," she told James.</p><p>"Do I look like somebody that employs an arrogant little punk?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After James was put in his place, he stormed out of SUR as though he had just been told his DJ career was over. Just like James, karma really is a bitch.&nbsp;</p><p>Jax Kennedy later revealed to Kristen that his supplements had caused him to have cysts in his chest and he underwent a procedure to have breast tissue removed.&nbsp;</p><p>As always seems to be the case with Jax, he put the cosmetic surgery down to health concerns. Yeah, we believe you, Mr. Taylor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/l-to-the-vp-756x1024.jpg><p>Later, Dayna and Nikolai showed up to help Stassi come to terms with all the drama in her life. Stassi’s brother revealed that Stassi was probably to blame for all of the drama with Scheana, prompting Stassi to reveal in a confessional that her little brother was probably right.&nbsp;</p><p>At the top of the hour, Lala was a no show at the airport for Ariana’s birthday celebrations. Might this lead to her exit from the series?</p><p>Sound off below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>9 Iconic GIFs of Stassi Schroeder</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2Z%2FcMLAp5ueqqCqurF50a6jnqtdqLKiv86nZG5llaW2tLvDnmRxZaKasKK8jKemZquYpMRw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pietro-boselli.html><span>←</span><span>Pietro Boselli</span></a>
