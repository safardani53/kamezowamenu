Even during some of my scenes they’re like ‘oh no, Lala no!’&nbsp;</p><p>"And I’m looking at them like ‘I’m coming for you next season!' Oh, wait…’” Lala says before she takes an awkward pause of silence, perhaps realizing her slip-up.&nbsp;</p><p>Listeners think she mistakenly dropped a massive secret about Jax and Brittany's Bravo fate during the episode.</p><p>Bravo fans took to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>&nbsp;to share their thoughts on a threat titled: "<a href=#>Jax</a> and Brittany coming back?"</p><p>One commenter speculated: "I wouldn't be surprised. Their watch-along show feels like kind of a temperature test."</p><p>Someone else chimed in: "Unpopular opinion alert: I'm all for Jax coming back so he and Tom can go at each other."</p><p>Another commenter suggested: "I just heard it as legitimate that's what went through her head for a split second and then she remembered they're no longer on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>"That happens to me with my best friend who passed. I still think, 'Oh, I should call him. He'd love this story.' Then I quickly remember."</p><h2>SPEAKING OUT</h2><p>Brittany and&nbsp;<a href=#>Jax</a>&nbsp;appeared on&nbsp;<a href=#>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a>, during which time they were asked if they "had any suspicion" about&nbsp;Tom&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Raquel Leviss' affair</a> prior to news breaking.</p><p>Brittany initially said she did not but quickly walked back on those comments.</p><p>She said: "There were times whenever we went to certain events when they came together and I was like, 'This is kind of odd.'</p><p>"But I figured Tom Sandoval makes friends, like, really fast with different people."</p><p>She concluded: "So I was like maybe they're just close friends right now."</p><p>Brittany also said that after the news broke she started "picking up all the Easter eggs."</p><p>Jax also said during the show: "Last time we saw them was <a href=#>at our friends' house</a> in Orange County and they were both together."</p><p>He said that <a href=#>Ariana Madix</a> – Tom's longtime girlfriend – called Tom during the party to tell him that her "grandmother passed away or got sick or something" and he continued partying.</p><p>Jax told host <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a>: "He didn't leave. He used the fact that he couldn't get an Uber. Meanwhile, people were coming in and out of the house all day long."</p><p>He added that he "didn't understand it in the beginning," but the circumstances "make sense" knowing what he knows now.</p><p>In 2021, a few months after Jax and Brittany were fired from the show, it returned with a new season.</p><p>Viewers quickly grew&nbsp;<a href=#>bored with the show</a>&nbsp;and didn't hold back online.</p><p>Several fans bashed the show as "boring" during the ninth season, which aired after Jax, Brittany, Stassi Schroeder, and Kristen Doute were all fired.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Viewers took to Twitter at the time to express just how much the show was missing those stars.</p><p>One person wrote: "I agree if you go woke you go broke, they kept the boring ones, Jax and Stassi were VPR, they are the stars, not TOM and TOM.. lol took it off DVR no need to watch, Ariana is a big turn off."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/NINTCHDBPICT000806703406.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/reality-vanderpump-rules-fans-call-806703521.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/editorial-use-l-r-jax-806703052.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYGh%2FeX6QaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBurtGiq62Znq56pK3Rra6roZedwW60xJqroZ2iYrKtecyorKyrkWLCr7HDoquenF2ltqR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anitta-amas-2022-dress-performance-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Singer Rocks 2-Piece Dress With Cutouts Hollywood Life</span></a>
