"There is competition to the point that we can actually make fun of it — we'll keep scores and laugh about it. At the end of the day, we're in this industry to have fun," adding, "We're a very close family, and we've always been supportive of one another."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stellan shared a similar sentiment <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>with The Daily Beast</a> in 2021, joking: "There's no competition, really. There's some joking competition at the dinner table, but I know they're better than me, so I've given up."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Acting isn't the only thing the Skarsgärds are good at, either: The family also counts models, film producers and doctors among them. Stellan insists, however, that there is no secret to raising such a gifted brood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have never had ambitions for them, other than that they should be decent people," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for everything to know about the Skarsgård family.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stellan-skarsgrd></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Stellan Skarsgård</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stellan, the patriarch of the Skarsgård family, was born June 13, 1951, in Gothenburg, Sweden. He started his acting career early, first appearing in school productions and later landing his first major role in 1968, when he starred in the hit Swedish television show Bombi Bitt. The show made Stellan a teen idol in his native Sweden.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was like being a pop star," Stellan recalled to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Independent</a> in 2020. "Screaming girls and all that s---."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The television series was just the beginning of what would become a five-decade-long (and counting) acting career for Stellan, ranging from notable Swedish films to major Hollywood blockbusters. He's particularly well known for his collaborations with Danish director Lars von Trier, appearing in six of his projects including Melancholia and the controversial Nymphomaniac.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We've grown to be friends, and we did that pretty quickly, actually, because I liked him so much as a person," Stellan <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told Slant magazine</a> about von Trier in 2014. "He's one of the most technically skillful directors in the world."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stateside, Stellan has appeared in everything from Pirates of the Caribbean and Thor to Mamma Mia! and Good Will Hunting. And even in his 70s, Stellan's career shows no signs of slowing down: He <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>picked up a Golden Globe</a> in 2020 for his role in the HBO miniseries Chernobyl, starred opposite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Timothée Chalamet</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Zendaya</a> in 2021's Dune and appeared in the Star Wars <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>prequel series Andor</a> on Disney+ in 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For being a Swede with an accent, I have been extremely successful internationally, so I can't complain," Stellan <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The Daily Beast</a> in 2020. "I'm a solid f------ actor, and I'd rather be an actor than a star."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stellan's family tree is almost as extensive as his acting resumé. The actor has been married twice: First to My Skarsgård from 1975 until their divorce in 2007 and then to film producer Megan Everett in 2009. Stellan and My share six children together (Alexander, Gustaf, Sam, Bill, Eija and Valter), while he and Megan have two sons (Ossian and Kolbjörn).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've had two beautiful wives — and very smart wives — and that's helped a lot. I'm not going to take much credit for anything," Stellan told The Daily Beast about his brood of 8 children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alexander-skarsgrd></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Alexander Skarsgård</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dia Dipasupil/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The eldest Skarsgård sibling, Alexander, was born on Aug. 25, 1976, in Stockholm. Alexander nabbed his first film role at just 7 years old, starring opposite Stellan in 1984's Åke och hans värld, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to the Los Angeles Times</a>. He followed that up with the lead role in the 1989 Swedish hit Hunden Som Log, but the fame and attention that followed led him to quit acting. Instead, he joined the Swedish Armed Forces at the age of 19.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was my way of going off into the unknown," Alexander <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told GQ</a> in 2011 about his time in the military. "I didn't want to just be somebody's son."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But after completing 18 months of military service, it was a visit to see his father in L.A. that reignited his acting career. "I obviously didn't have representation out there but [my father's] agent asked, 'You're in town, would it be fun to go to an audition? Do you think that'd be interesting?' I was like, 'Yeah, it'd be a great story to tell my friends back home.' " Alexander recalled to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Good Morning America</a> in 2018. That audition resulted in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>his first American acting gig</a>, the 2001 comedy Zoolander.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was HBO, however, that would truly launch Alexander's acting career. He earned critical acclaim when he landed a lead role in the 2008 HBO miniseries Generation Kill and became a household name appearing on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the HBO hit series True Blood</a> for seven years. Then, in 2017, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>starred as an abusive husband</a> opposite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Nicole Kidman</a> in HBO's miniseries Big Little Lies — a role that would earn him an Emmy, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>SAG Award</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>a Golden Globe</a> in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It felt like such a honest and nuanced portrayal and depiction of an abusive relationship," Alexander <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told EW</a> about his role on Big Little Lies. "It wasn't lazy in the way it was portrayed. It wasn't cliché."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since his Big Little Lies success, Alexander has also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>appeared in the CBS miniseries The Stand</a>, returned to HBO for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>season three of Succession</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>reunited with Kidman in the 2022 epic Viking thriller The Northman</a>. But despite his acting achievements, Alexander still has difficulty fully enjoying his success.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I sometimes have a hard time allowing myself to enjoy a moment. I'm not good at sitting and feeling that I've achieved something," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared with GQ</a> in 2022. "I'm trying to allow myself, with humility, to take more joy in my accomplishments."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, the actor confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that he had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed his first baby</a> with girlfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tuva Novotny</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gustaf-skarsgrd></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Gustaf Skarsgård</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jesse Grant/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on Nov. 12, 1980, in Stockholm, Gustaf took the earliest interest in acting out of all of his siblings. By the age of 6, he knew he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and was already attending drama school in Sweden.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To any child, the first occupations that are presented to you are your parents'," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Interview magazine</a> in 2017. "I was appealed to my dad's occupation from the get-go."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a teen, Gustaf turned down roles in soaps and instead attended the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting for college. "I was really pretentious in a sense and was like, I'm going to drama school, to learn the craft," he shared with Interview. His early career was in theater, performing with the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm until his first major film role came in the 2003 Swedish horror film Evil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gustaf's stateside big break came with the 2010 film The Way Back. The second eldest Skarsgård sibling is perhaps best known, however, for his television work: He played Floki on the History Channel series Vikings from 2013 to 2020, nabbed his "dream role" on the second season of HBO's Westworld in 2018 and starred in the 2020 Netflix series Cursed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I expected to be doing basement theater in the suburbs of Stockholm," Gustaf told Interview about his career. "But here I am."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a November 2021 Instagram post, Gustaf revealed that he has another important role: Father. "Eternal gratitude to the most high for bestowing upon me the greatest gift of my life: her life. One year ago tomorrow she came and brought a dimensional shift to my universe," he wrote alongside a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>picture</a> of himself and his baby daughter. "Love is too futile a word."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sam-skarsgrd></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Sam Skarsgård</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ibl/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sam Skarsgård, who was born on June 5, 1982, in Sweden, also followed his parent's footsteps when it came to his career — but instead of pursuing acting like his father and older brothers, he went into medicine like his mother My. "We're either actors or doctors," Alexander <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told The Inquirer</a> about his family in 2013. "Mom went through medical school while raising six kids and taking care of the household."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alexander and his younger brother Bill spoke more about Sam's medical career in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a conversation with Interview magazine</a> in 2017. "He works at an ICU so he, on a daily basis, saves lives," Alexander said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bill continued, emphasizing that their mother and brother's careers in medicine trumped the rest of the family's in Hollywood. "There's definitely a sense of embarrassment about what it is artists really do, at least for me in terms of acting. We have a mom and a brother who literally save lives."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bill-skarsgrd></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Bill Skarsgård</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Barry King/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fourth boy born to Stellan and My was son Bill, who arrived on Aug. 9, 1990.

However, he wanted to do so without the help of his already famous father and big brothers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've always felt a very strong need to do it myself," he said to PEOPLE. "The association with my brothers and my father is already so big, I didn't want them to have anything to do with what I did. I needed them to feel that I am completely responsible for what I do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After some initial success in Sweden, Bill landed a role on the Netflix series Hemlock Grove in 2013. From there, he appeared in Allegiant in 2016, Deadpool 2 in 2018 and was a series regular on Hulu's Castle Rock the same year. But perhaps his most recognizable role was that of Pennywise the Clown in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the 2017 horror film It</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the 2019 sequel It Chapter Two</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was really excited to do a full character transformation into something that's so far away from who I am in every way," Bill <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE about playing Pennywise</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bill plays another villainous role opposite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Keanu Reeves</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>in 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4</a>.
