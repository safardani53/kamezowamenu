Aged eleven, their eldest daughter has stopped eating and speaking.</p><p>“Alongside diagnoses of <a href=#>autism</a> and selective mutism, her parents slowly become aware of another source for her distress: her imperiled future on a rapidly heating planet.</p><p>“Steered by her determination to understand the truth, the family begins to see the deep connections between their own and the planet’s suffering.</p><p>“Against forces that try to silence them, disparaging them for being different, they discover ways to strengthen, heal, and act in the world. And then one day, fifteen-year-old Greta decides to go on strike.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn1xgZhtb21nl6eyta2MrZ%2BuppKav6h5z5qpnqakqHqurcuepZpllae7rq3NZqqvmZ6psnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shirley-watts-widow-of-rolling-stones-drummer-charlie-watts-dead-at-84.html><span>←</span><span>Shirley Watts, Widow of Rolling Stones Drummer Charlie Watts, Dead at 84</span></a>
