Another family having serious drama on Thanksgiving? The Archibalds. After Nate’s dad (guest star <strong>Sam Robards</strong>) returned from hiding out in Dominica, Chuck and Vanessa (<a href=#><strong>Jessica Szohr</strong></a>) were contacted by FBI agents who revealed The Captain was planning to hold them ransom.</p><p>Elsewhere, Lily, Serena and Eric (<strong>Connor Paolo</strong>) returned to the diner they ate at during the season 1 Thanksgiving episode after Eric revealed Lily’s husband Bart (<strong>Robert John Burke</strong>) was tracking them with a PI.</p><p><strong>Season 3: “The Treasure of Serena Madre”&nbsp;</strong><br>Cue the <a href=#><strong>Jason Derulo</strong></a>! One of the most beloved episodes by fans, Gossip Girl brought the whole gang together for a season 3 Thanksgiving feast. On the menu? A not-so-secret affair between Serena and Nate’s cousin, Tripp (guest star <strong>Aaron Tveit</strong>), Blair assuming her mother was pregnant (spoiler alert: it’s Dorota!) and Dan being forced to face his feelings for Vanessa after a threesome with the pair and<a href=#><strong> Hilary Duff</strong></a>’s Olivia Burke.</p><p><strong>Season 4: “Gaslit”</strong><br>Everyone was convinced Serena was back to her old ways after she woke up lost and confused following Chuck’s Saints and Sinners ball during season 4. While Lily decided to commit her daughter to rehab, Blair learned the truth about Juliet (guest star <a href=#><strong>Katie Cassidy</strong></a>) from Jenny (<a href=#><strong>Taylor Momsen</strong></a>) and enlisted Dan’s help to save try and save Serena.</p><p><strong>Season 6: “It’s Really Complicated”&nbsp;</strong><br>“What is Thanksgiving without a side of drama?” Blair asked Serena during the final season of Gossip Girl. After the Serena-themed chapter of Dan’s book was released during the Thanksgiving dinner, chaos ensued. While Nate punched lonely boy in the face, Serena turned to her ex Steven (guest star<a href=#><strong> Barry Watson</strong></a>).</p><p><b>Revival Season 1: ‘One Upon a Time in the Upper West’<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></b></p><p class="x_p2 x_ContentPasted0">A new group of Manhattan’s elite, but the same old Thanksgiving chaos.
