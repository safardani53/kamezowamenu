Well, this right here is the VW Grand California — a hotel on wheels.
Sure, there’s no room service. And the khazi doubles as a shower.

I’m a foster carer so can have up to three children in the back and I need a big boot for a buggy if needed. My budget is around £12,000.</p><p><strong>Debra</strong></p><p><strong>A </strong>There’s a car that would really suit you, Debra, and it’s the Honda HR-V. Small road footprint but big on the inside. It’ll easily swallow family stuff and, as it’s a Honda, it will be as&nbsp; reliable as a Swiss clock. Good, low-mileage used examples on a 66-plate can be found for about £11,000.</p><p><strong>Q </strong>CAN you please help? I need to choose a company car urgently. I do around 30,000 miles a year and can choose from a VW Tiguan, BMW X1, Lexus ES 300h, Mercedes C200 d or a C220 dAMG Line Premium automatic.</p><p><strong>Darren Graham</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> Some great cars to choose from on that list, Darren, but the C220 d is the obvious choice. That Merc 2-litre turbodiesel is a beaut and an AMG Line&nbsp; Premium will be swimming in toys. The Lexus is a good bet for company tax breaks but I’d be veering for the Merc as the best choice there.</p><p>NB: after I emailed the above advice to&nbsp; Darren, he responded to say he was in a Merc dealership looking at the C220d! A wise choice sir.</p><p><strong>Q </strong>APART from a 4x4, which is the best small hatchback that will cope well in winter weather?</p><p><strong>Pam Thornhill</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> You are planning ahead! Any modern, front-wheel-drive hatchback with traction and electronic stability control, and a decent set of tyres too, should get you through the worst our cruddy weather can throw at you. However, if you want extra peace of mind, buy a Peugeot 2008 with Grip Control, a system specially designed to get the car through snowy conditions.</p><h2>Braking news with Rachel Burgess</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NIP000492403754.jpg><ul><li>&nbsp;RENAULT has set a new Nurburgring record for&nbsp; front-wheel drive cars with the Megane RS Trophy R ousting the Honda Civic Type R.&nbsp; Talking of moving fast – order a Renault today and you’ll get up to £1,000 off, in celebration of today’s Monaco Grand Prix.</li><li>WOULD you buy an EV if you could charge it in 20 minutes?
