<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Courtney Robertson's Tell-All Book Features Adrian Grenier's Manhood</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Now this is a tell-all. <strong>Courtney Robertson</strong>'s new book, I Didn't Come Here to Make Friends: Confessions of a Reality Show Villain, is chock-full of juicy details and TMI tidbits, not just about the author herself but also about some very famous leading men. Prior to her controversial stint on <strong>Ben Flajnik</strong>'s season of The Bachelor in 2012, the model, 30, hooked up with actors <strong>Jesse Metcalfe</strong> and <strong><a href=#>Adrian Grenier</a></strong>, the latter of whom is apparently very well endowed.</p><p>In a chapter about her pre-Bachelor trysts—appropriately titled "Catwalking & Starf—ing"—Robertson recalls meeting Grenier at an A-list party on Oscar night. They bonded over a "mutual loneliness in L.A.," and though she "didn't feel a spark" with the Entourage star, 37, she agreed to go out with him. She insists in the book that they never had "actual sex"—but she did see him naked. "He had the biggest penis I'd ever seen—and the biggest bush!" she writes.</p><p>One Hollywood star she does count among her lovers? Desperate Housewives hunk Metcalfe. Robertson and the John Tucker Must Die actor met at that same A-list Oscar party where she met Grenier, and dated off and on for a couple of years, even going together to the Emmys in 2005.</p><p>"I wish I could say that we were the greatest lovers since Christian Grey and Ana Steele," she says in the book, referring to the lead characters in E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey. "But I can't lie. The sex was pretty average. Jesse needed a lot of reassurance."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He needed help, too. "Jesse was also, by his own admission, an alcoholic and an addict," she writes of her ex, noting he would disappear for days at a time. They split up for good when he went to rehab in 2007.</p><p>At another point, Robertson was set up with <strong><a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a></strong>'s now-husband, <strong>Jim Toth</strong>. Her relationship with the Hollywood agent never advanced, she explains, because he was "ready for marriage and babies, the whole nine yards," and she wasn't. The next time she heard of him, she says, "he'd become Mrs. Reese Witherspoon."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqoraKpu6bFjKumm52iqcCwutJmq56knGKurbiMm6aoo12nsrexwKWqZpmUp7aiuoygqZ6mmZq%2FtHnMmqWhp5%2BZenN8kG1pb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./antoine-griezmann-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Antoine Griezmann Net Worth [2023 Update]: House &amp;amp; Salary</span></a>
