According to her statement to People magazine, the relief would consist of “100,000 crisis kits stocked with blankets, sleeping bags, amenity kits, non-perishables, and water, as well as generators.”</p><p>BStrong, Frankel’s charity, collaborated with Global Empowerment Mission and originally intended to provide $10 million in relief. Nonetheless, the TV celebrity and entrepreneur stated on Friday that the target had been raised to $20 million. The philanthropist posted updates on the endeavor and footage of assistance boxes being packed from her organization’s warehouses on Instagram.</p><p>According to BStrong’s official website,</p><p>“Our new objective is to provide 20 m in assistance through 80 containers.” If there is a mass evacuation, we will aim for 100 containers, which we have done effectively in previous calamities. It’s a terrifying scenario.”</p><h2>What is the net worth of ‘RHONY’ actress Bethenny Frankel?</h2><p>According to statistics compiled from several sources, Bethenny Frankel is allegedly valued between $70 and $80 million. The sale of her cocktail firm, Skinnygirl, in 2011 provided the bulk of her income. The firm offers a wide range of items, including alcoholic drinks, food, kitchenware, vitamins, eyeglasses, and clothing such as jeans. While the 51-year-old New York native’s agreement with Bravo TV for her presence in the first season of RHONY was originally only for roughly $7,250, it was eventually renegotiated into much more.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bethenny-Frankel-2.jpg alt="Bethenny Frankel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bethenny Frankel allegedly earned an average of $40,000 each episode throughout her eight seasons on the program. According to Reality Blurb, her 2018 paycheck was moreover $1 million. Meanwhile, some other websites estimate her salary for her recent performances every season to be approximately $1.3 million. Frankel has received around $6.1 million for her participation in about 153 episodes of the program. In addition, in 2018, she was a part of Bravo TV’s Bethenny & Fredrik, who also acted as an executive producer. Similarly, Frankel appeared in and co-produced another mini-series, The Big Shot, with Bethenny in 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bethenny-Frankel-3.jpg alt="Bethenny Frankel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The majority of her money, however, is still covered by the proceeds from the sale of Skinnygirl to Beam Global for an estimated $120 million. Furthermore, Bethenny Frankel’s disaster relief organization, BStrong, may be able to give her tax breaks for her charitable and philanthropic donations.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZnqyYmruvxYyfqZqmm5q5brXSZqerp6aesaq6xmZpaWWdnrmttc6nZLCnoqm1brvFZpymnaKcsq%2Bv2Gaqrqigobamv4ytpmatm6euqrrEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-joba-chamberlain-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Joba Chamberlain Dating Now</span></a>
