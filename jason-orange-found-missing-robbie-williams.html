He was queuing very patiently with everyone else waiting to pick up their clothes.”</p><p>And it wasn’t a flying visit, as I can reveal Jason has been house hunting around the picturesque Cotswold villages, including pricey properties in Stow-on-the-Wold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000548227737.jpg><p>An insider explained: “Last month Jason booked into a hotel in Stow and spent the week looking around the area eyeing up houses. He looked around a couple of areas including Moreton-in-Marsh and was being shown properties that cost around the £10million mark.</p><p>“The places he viewed included an enormous manor house which was set back from the road and very secluded. Jason likes the idea of living a quiet life in the countryside and the Cotswolds is a really desirable place to be. Plus it’s not far from London.”</p><p>If Jason does take the plunge, he will join an exclusive group of celebs who have set themselves up with country piles in the region, including David and Victoria Beckham, Kate Moss and Liz Hurley.</p><p>After Jason stepped back from the spotlight he remained on good terms with his former bandmates Robbie, Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000124993727-1.jpg><p>But he’s not very good at staying in touch, which is why I stepped in to help when Robbie admitted he had been off the radar too long. I told you in Bizarre yesterday how he had said: “I should hire a private detective.”</p><p>Next time you know you just have to call me, Rob. And if you get him back on tour, I want 20 per cent.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Robbie Williams, London's SSSE Wembley Arena</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000548227725.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>★★★☆☆</p><p>I SENT my reporter Howell Davies to The Robbie Williams Christmas Party. Here is what he thought . . .</p><p>MAKE no mistake, Robbie is one of the country’s greatest ever showmen – but when he doesn’t have all his hits to back him up, his act doesn’t quite have the same pull fans are used to.</p><p>Fresh from the release of his album The Christmas Present, he burst on stage in a red sequined jacket and after a few minutes was belting out Let Me Entertain You.</p><p>But the whole show was heavily weighted towards his new festive material, which grew tiresome quickly and wasn’t enough to get the crowd going.</p><p>He admitted: “Some of you in the audience are going to be a bit f***ed this evening if, a) you don’t like Christmas, this isn’t the gig for you, and b) if you haven’t bought my album, you should probably go home now.”</p><p>There were moments of excellence when he returned to his classics including Feel and Angels.</p><p>But if Robbie really wants to put on a brilliant show, he needs to stop trying to be the British Michael Buble and focus on showing us the man everyone came to see.</p><h2>Renee's latest lead role</h2><p>RENEE Zellweger has generated a major Oscar buzz for her performance as Judy Garland, but she is more worried about her sick dog than winning awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000548227725.jpg><p>She said: “I have a dog recovering from a hip replacement so that’s where my mind is at the moment.” Renee also gave up trying to contact Judy’s daughter, Liza Minnelli, about the movie, Judy, before legend Liza slammed it on social media.</p><p>At a Q&A session for the film in LA, she said: “I did not reach out to Judy’s other children because I was not successful in reaching out to Liza.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dream of asking them to share tidbits with me. But I’d liked to have asked what they would have hoped for a film like this.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">bizbit</h3></p><p>LANA Del Rey has finally gone public with her boyfriend of three months, US cop Sean Larkin. She shared a picture on Instagram of Sean kissing the top of her head with a caption packed with heart emojis.</p><h2>Yule never believe it's Katy</h2><p>I HAD to look twice at this picture of Katy Perry – I thought she was an ornament on the Christmas tree.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000548257510-e1576616120573.jpg><p><a href=#>The I Kissed A Girl singer</a> looked feverishly festive as she decorated her silver tinsel tree while wearing a strapless Santa outfit and gold reindeer antlers. Katy posted the snap on to Instagram – part of a digital advent calendar she’s running on social media – with a caption referencing her new song, Cosy Little Christmas.</p><p>She wrote: “Day 15 of 25 Days of Cosy: Ten days left until Christmas! What are you hoping Santa leaves under your tree?”</p><p>Most can only dream of finding Katy...</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">bizbit</h3></p><p>ENNIFER Coolidge says she’d love to make Legally Blonde 3. The American actress, explained: “I know that there’s a script in the works. But I just don’t know what the timeline is. I would love to play Paulette again.”</p><br><h2>instaglam</h2><p><a href=#>KYLIE Jenner</a> is all dolled up in this look for her latest photoshoot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000548395759.jpg><h2>Rick's on a health kick</h2><p><a href=#>RICK Astley</a> is planning a huge health kick in the new year. The veteran singer, who is set for a tour Down Under, plans on hitting the gym and cutting down on booze.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN BIZARRE</h2></p><p>He said: “I want to be a bit more in shape. It’s a health thing, I’ll be 54 soon. If you don’t get a hold of it it’s so easy to get out of hand. I’ve been busy, but something has to give. It takes its toll if you get into the habit of having drinks and gin and tonics. I’m just going to cut down though.”</p><p>Speaking at the Bloodwise charity Christmas carol concert at the Albert Hall on Tuesday, he added: “It’s easier for fellas, most of us get away with murder in terms of getting old. Guys with grey hair are silver foxes.”</p><p>I can’t wait to embrace old age . . .</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">bizmeter</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/as-comp-bizmeter.jpg><ul><li>VIOLA Davis has signed up for Sandra Bullock's new movie.
