They make my birthday perfect," she added, though she deleted the post shortly after.</p><h2>FAN SPECULATION</h2><p>Fans found the post suspicious, taking to <a href=#>Reddit</a> to discuss potential marriage problems between Jenelle and David.</p><p>"Definitely Trouble in Paradise," one wrote alongside a screenshot of the original post.</p><p>"He’s probably just straight up ignoring her which is sending her into an abandonment spiral. Those poor kids need to get out of that house and into therapy," a second suggested.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"It’s kind of crazy watching their relationship drag out all these years knowing it’s gonna implode under the weight of its own dysfunction at some point. Honestly, the amount of unhappiness they’re willing to stomach in their marriage is impressive at this stage," a third ranted.</p><p>"Just end it. It’s going to end anyway. There’s a zero percent chance this is an enduring love story lmao," they added.</p><p>A fourth claimed: "Just you wait. Tomorrow, it’ll be 'My husband is the best, I thought he was up to no good all night but was secretly planning a huge birthday surprise for me!'"</p><p>"Whoa. This is different. All their embarrassing public fights before, I don’t think I’ve ever heard her sling names like that at him. She’s bigggg mad this time," a final remarked.</p><h2>CALLING IT QUITS?</h2><p>Later, Jenelle added a second post of her just her left hand held out in front of a <a href=#>Christmas</a> tree.</p><p>The mother of three showed off her <a href=#>Apple</a> watch with a photo of herself as the screen background.</p><p>However, fans were quick to notice that her wedding band was missing.</p><p>"Where’s your wedding band, Jenelle?" one asked alongside a screenshot of the post on Reddit.</p><p>"It's the calling David a narcissist while having her own face on her watch for me. They're definitely meant for each other," a second noted.</p><p>"Just further confirms how toxic the relationship is. The healthiest relationship doesn't have a trace of it on social media.</p><p>Like seriously how stupid do you look trashing your husband and then you patch it back up and go on like nothing happened . They are both morons," another agreed.</p><p>A third asked: "Do you need to show your bare ring finger when taking a pic of your watch? This level of publicized petty is comparable to me removing my bf from my top 8 when we got in a fight."</p><h2>WIFE'S WARNING</h2><p>Fans have speculated a split between Jenelle and her husband after her <a href=#>31st birthday celebration quickly turned sour</a>.</p><p>The same night, <a href=#>Jenelle</a>&nbsp;shared a celebratory snap with an out-of-frame&nbsp;<a href=#>David</a> toasting beers over wings at a Tavern for her birthday eve.</p><p>She then deleted the image from her Instagram Stories.</p><p>Jenelle then posted an all-text Instagram Story: "Tell me where @Easondavid88 is because it's my birthday at midnight and he's gone."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>David and Jenelle are the parents of their five-year-old daughter Ensley.</p><p>She also shares her son Kaiser, eight, with her baby daddy,&nbsp;<a href=#>Nathan Griffith</a>, 34, and is the mother of her 13-year-old son Jace with her ex Andrew Lewis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-slams-783968832.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-shares-778727398-3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaWmEdYSSaKuenZ5iurC5jKOcp52cobJuv8uapKxlmKrAo63NnWSdmaaesW6%2B1KKlnpxdl7azwMedmLJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stacey-dash-calls-jesse-williams-a-plantation-slave-after-his-bet-speech-w211841.html><span>←</span><span>Stacey Dash Calls Jesse Williams a Plantation Slave After His BET Speech</span></a>
