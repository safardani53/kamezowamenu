The angle measured 141.9°.</p><p>By contrast, 98 per cent of participants rated an anonymous woman with a much squarer jawline as less attractive.</p><p>Eighty-two per cent of participants also rated model Doutzen Kroes highly pleasing to the eye, as her jaw had "a pleasing vertical position" in line with her lips.</p><p>As for the review of <a aria-label="male jawlines (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">male jawlines</a>, participants were shown an anonymised mixture of celebrities and non-celebrities, including Ben Affleck, <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, <a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a>, Matthew Bomer, Michael Fassbinder, Johny Depp and <a href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a>.</p><p>Almost half of the 81 participants were facial surgeons.</p><p>They were asked to judge the width of the jaw of the men pictured, the steepness of the jaw from a front-on angle, how high up on the face the jaw was, the face profile view, and the steepness of the jaw from the side on angle.</p><p>"We found clear indications of the preferred characteristics of a male jaw angle," the authors said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>A 130° gonial angle was judged to be most attractive.</p><p>The jaw being a similar width to the rest of the face was also deemed more alluring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/online-survey-online-survey-photographs-865601629.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/online-survey-online-survey-photographs-865601661.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/online-survey-online-survey-photographs-865601638.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/online-survey-online-survey-photographs-865601632.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/liam-hemsworth-attends-netflixs-extraction-865609211.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ5f5Vvbmpno5i2prrCnmSfp6Kiwq2tjJucrKxdn664uMinnGajkamybrnOrKpmn5mctm60wJ2gnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sudan-williams-19891116-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sudan Williams (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
