They annoy me. I’m like the mama bear of the group. Although sometimes they don’t act like it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/million-dollar-listing-la-tracy-tudor-bravo-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=414 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Though we will see several familiar castmates returning this season, one face Tracy is extra excited to see is <strong>Fredrik Eklund</strong>, 43, who will be crossing over from NY to LA. “I love him,” Tracy said. “So you’re going to see him on the show this season. And he definitely pops in and out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>But from the sounds of things, the entire cast isn’t thrilled for Fredrik’s arrival. “It’s fun to have him here and a little bit of his energy,” Tracy, whose new book, Fear Is Just A Four Letter Word (coming out July 20),&nbsp;added. “He obviously is at the same company as Josh Altman and I and I’m really good friends with them. I adore him. So we’ll see how the rest of the cast takes to it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/million-dollar-listing-la-fredrik-eukland-bravo-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=827 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>To see how how the drama shakes out, fans will have to tune in on June 16 to Bravo at 6pm PST. But for now, Tracy is offering a nice little tease. “I’m interested in how bad it really gets,” Tracy revealed. “And then also, I have some pretty heavy drama with a couple of clients, which is never fun. But nonetheless, its sort of part of our business and that was all caught on camera, so we’ll see how it plays out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH13e5BvZqahnKG2sLqMnaalpJGneq210q2gp59doa5uv8SaqqimXWZ%2FbsDRmpqyZaSqwbC%2BjKKlrZ2iq7amw44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mariah-carey-diet-sex-workout-secrets-losing-weight.html><span>←</span><span>Mariah Careys Diet &amp;amp; Sex Workout Secrets To Losing Weight Hollywood Life</span></a>
