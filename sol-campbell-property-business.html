WHERE THE HEART IS</h2><p>His playing days might've been spent in North London, but when it comes to building a property portfolio he's not so interested in that area.</p><p>Over the years, he bought homes in expensive areas of West London that mere mortals could only dream of living in.</p><p>The standout property was a £25m townhouse with stunning views across the Thames and Albert Bridge.</p><p>It boasts six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a drawing room, library, dining room, as well as a separate mews home that can be reached by an underground tunnel.</p><p>In 2008, with the help of his missus, the 7,224 sq/ft space, which also has a 45-foot garden and a lift, had a complete renovation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

proposed mansion tax which would've cost him £250,000-per-year.</p><p>He called Labour: "the grim reaper of business entrepreneurs or anyone that has done well!"</p><p>Campbell added: "An Englishman's home is his castle, there will be uproar with this tax!"<br></p><h2>CARLYLE MANSIONS</h2><p>Carlyle Mansions are a block of luxury flats that can be found on Cheyne Walk in the Kensington and Chelsea borough.</p><p>It earned the nickname the 'Writer's block' because of the high-number of prolific authors who lived there.</p><p>Of course, wanting to join that exclusive club, Sol bought an apartment for a reported price of £4.25m in 2011 that used to be owned by James Bond creator Ian Fleming.</p><p>Located on the fifth floor, it boasts four bedrooms, two bathrooms, – one en suite – as well as a shower room, study area, laundry, passenger lift and porter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000534005910.jpg><p>To boot, there's a lavish marble kitchen and an interconnecting reception room that can be found at the front of the building.</p><p>Again, perturbed by Labour's purported mansion tax, he listed it for £6.75m in 2015.</p><p>Lucky for Sol, mansion tax never came to fruition, so he took both this and his other Chelsea abode off the market.</p><h2>A HISTORY LESSON</h2><p>In his twilight years, Campbell had a spell at Newcastle United from 2010-11 before he hung up his boots.</p><p>But, he wasn't interested in living in the city centre, renting a property and then counting down the days until he called time on his career.</p><p>Sol bought the Grade II-listed Hallington Hall in Northumberland, near Whittington, which was built in 1768 and renovated by his wife Barratt.</p><p>The 60-acre estate has nine bedrooms, seven en-suite, a games room, private cinema, and three cottages within its grounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000534006005.jpg><p>There was rumoured to be a huge portrait of Sol inside the home, as well as a games room full of framed football shirts.</p><p>But the towering centre half put it on the market a year after he was racially abused in the nearby Hexham town centre.</p><p>However, he had to slash the asking price by £700k to £5.25m when he struggled to find any takers for it.</p><h2>PART OF THE FURNITURE</h2><p><a href=#>Together with his wife Fiona</a>, the daughter of North East builder Lawrie Barratt, Sol owns FBC - a luxury furniture brand selling high-quality, traditional British items.</p><p>They launched FBC in 2013, and it has continued to go from strength to strength - adding a showroom in Westminster to join its Pimlico store.</p><p>From armchairs that cost around £5k, to Christopher Boots lighting and fancy artwork, FBC deliver it all.</p><img

href=#>Real Business</a> last year.</p><p>"For me, I could see a lot of transferable skills from my playing days that I knew I could use in a business environment.”</p><p>And you can't argue that Sol has excelled off the pitch just as well as he did on it.</p><p class=postsid
