The news came after a search for senior contestants went on for years, leading some fans to wonder whether the spinoff would ever really happen.</p><p>“It feels amazing and it’s still sinking in,” Gerry said on <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> last month, adding that he’s hoping to find a “high-energy” partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Golden-Bachelor-Star-Gerry-Turner-Reveals-the-Age-Range-He-Gave-Casting-Directors-for-Contestants-2.jpg><p>Before his entrée into reality TV, Gerry was married to his high school sweetheart, Toni, who died in 2017. In July, he told “Bachelor Happy Hour” podcast cohosts <a href=#><strong>Joe Amabile</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Serena Pitt</strong></a> that he thinks Toni <a href=#>would be “very pleased”</a> by his participation in the show.</p><p>“I have a picture of her in my walk-in closet, so every night I’m in there and I see her picture. It’s the only one now that I have in the house and in the mornings, I see her picture and you know, we talk,” he explained. “I’ll make a brief comment — or sometimes that talk is silent. But here, lately, in the last couple of months, you know, my question for her is always, ‘So, what do you think of this? Am I doing the right thing?’ And I really have strong positive feelings about it. I think she would be very happy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple shared two daughters, Jenny and Angie. According to Gerry, his daughters and granddaughters are all “very excited” about his upcoming <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> debut. “They send me a lot of positive reinforcement,” he told Variety.</p><p>Production on The Golden Bachelor is currently underway, with former Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a> filming a date with Gerry’s contestants earlier this week. The spinoff premieres on ABC this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2cvK2wxKdkm5mTnbKtu9GsZKCdoqfGbr7Er5yapKNirqixjKuYp5%2BVYrWmecaarZ5lk5bAtbXNoGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./myleene-klass-bikini-lingerie.html><span>←</span><span>Myleene Klass, 45, leads stars looking incredible in festive bikinis and lingerie as they 'join Sant</span></a>
