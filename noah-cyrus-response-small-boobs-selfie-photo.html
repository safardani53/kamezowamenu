Earlier this week, the singer shared a mirror selfie of herself, in which she’s wearing nothing but a strapless, bandeau bra top and gray sweatpants. The ensemble is cool and casual, but also super sexy, with the 19-year-old’s toned stomach on display. She’s seated on the counter in a massive bathroom for the pic, and is wearing little to no makeup for a completely natural look. While most people commented about how great she looked, though, one person couldn’t help but say something rude.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“My 13 yr old friend has bigger t**s than you,” the hater wrote. Well, Noah wasn’t going to just let him get away with it, and so she clapped back, “U look at ur 13 yr old friends t**s?” SLAY! Luckily, Noah doesn’t seem too bothered by the hate, and she received love from stars like&nbsp;<strong>Katy Perry, Paris Hilton</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Dinah Jane</strong> from&nbsp;<strong>Fifth Harmony</strong> on the photo. Paris commented with a ‘heart eye’ emoji, while Katy wrote, “No one else can feel it for you.” Noah’s older sister,&nbsp;<strong>Brandi Cyrus</strong>, also commented with a series of lightning strike emojis.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Noah is no stranger to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posting sexy pics</a> on her Instagram. In fact, just before that mirror selfie, she posted another one, in which she wears a bra top and jeans, with nothing else. Earlier this week, she also shared some bikini pics, with her backside facing the camera for a sexy look from behind.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Of course, Noah comes from a famous family, so she’s been dealing with scrutiny for probably as long as she can remember. Her sister,&nbsp;<strong>Miley Cyrus</strong>, is no stranger to getting hate online, either, so she has someone to lean on if things ever get tough, too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH12e49qZqenkZ16pMXRrqpmqpWovbC60p5krKWRoblurs6omaxlo5q5p7XEZqehp6SkfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nia-vardalos-weight-plastic-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Nia Vardalos Weight Loss, Plastic Surgery, and Net Worth</span></a>
