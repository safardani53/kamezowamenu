Justin “took it like a champ,” says Pip Holcombe, a Body Piercer at Millenium Ink and the owner of Wildcat Body Jewelry. “He was great,” he only bled “a little,” and his eyes watered, too, which Pip says happens to everyone."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Pip also pierced one of Justin’s friends ears, and says that everyone in Justin’s crew was “really nice.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As for the actual nose ring, it was a “clear gem bioplast nose stud,” says Pip. So, no big, sparkly diamond — yet!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The piercing happened at around 10:30pm at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pierre’s</a> in Yaletown, which is a super hip area in Vancouver. The lounge was closed so it was just Justin, his friends, and there were “lots” of “hot girls” inside with them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>[jwplatform O8Bgl0iV]</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Pip also told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that he did ask for a picture after the piercing, but Justin politely turned him down. Bummer! Thankfully, Pip was totally respectful of Justin’s decision. Hey, it was his night off, after all!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Justin’s nose stud will make it’s first public appearance at Vancouver’s Rogers Arena on Friday, March 11. Unfortunately, without a performance of “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>One Less Lonely Girl</a>” none of the fans will get to see it too up close and personal. Hopefully Justin posts more hot pics of his stud very soon!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — What do YOU think of Justin’s piercing? Are you totally into it or do you wish he wouldn’t have had it done?
