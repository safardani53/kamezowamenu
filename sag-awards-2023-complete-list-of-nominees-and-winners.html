The <a href=#>2023 SAG Awards</a> honored the best of film and television on Sunday, February 26.</p><p>The <a href=#>29th annual awards ceremony</a> were held at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Century City, California, with Hollywood legend <a href=#><strong>Sally Field</strong></a> receiving the SAG Life Achievement Award. Her trophy was presented by her Amazing Spider-Man costar <a href=#><strong>Andrew Garfield</strong></a>.</p><p>“Sally is an amazing actor with an enormous range and an uncanny ability to embody any character,” SAG-AFTRA president <a href=#><strong>Fran Drescher</strong></a> said in a January statement. “She has an enduring career because she is authentic in her performance and always projects likability and humanity – she just connects. That’s part of why she has sustained her massive fandom and incredibly rich and layered career. Sally is a massive star with a working actor’s ethos – just keep doing the work, being as good as you can.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Life Achievement Award</a> is voted upon by members of the SAG-AFTRA National Honors and Tributes Committee and is the highest honor bestowed by the Screen Actors Guild. Previous winners include Field’s <a href=#>80 for Brady</a> costars <a href=#><strong>Rita Moreno</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lily Tomlin</strong></a>, along with <a href=#><strong>Helen Mirren</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Robert De Niro</strong></a> and <strong>Alan Alda</strong>.</p><p>Field’s legacy within the industry has spanned decades, but <a href=#>the 2023 SAG Awards also recognized up-and-coming talents</a> of both the big and small screens. Breakout stars <a href=#><strong>Ashley Park</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Haley Lu Richardson</strong></a> announced this year’s nominations via Instagram Live in January.</p><p><a href=#>Ozark</a> led the TV categories with a total of four nominations, including Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. On the film side, The Banshees of Inisherin and Everything Everywhere All at Once were tied with five nods each. The latter took home the win for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sag-awards-2023-complete-list-of-nominees-and-winners-Michelle-Yeoh-feature.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong></a> continued her impressive awards season streak after <a href=#>collecting the 2023 Golden Globe</a> for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her role as Evelyn Wang in Everything Everywhere All at Once. The comedy-drama was directed by <strong>Daniel Kwan</strong> and <strong>Daniel Scheinert</strong> (a.k.a. The Daniels) and costars <strong>Ke Huy Quan</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Stephanie Hsu</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></a>, all of whom received individual nominations at the 2023 SAGs.</p><p>“I feel really grateful to be alongside Michelle on this journey,” Hsu told The Hollywood Reporter ahead of the ceremony, <a href=#>describing what makes a strong costar</a>. “I know that every card that has ever been stacked against me in this industry has been stacked against her tenfold. And it’s not like when the movie came out, all those difficulties went away for me or for her. This just feels like such an important moment — I feel so grateful that I get to witness her making history right before my eyes. And alongside her.”</p><p>The Broadway vet added: “She deserves it. We as a community deserve to be seen; people deserve to be seen, valued and know that this is possible for them. If you don’t see it, it’s very hard to believe it.”</p><p>Scroll down for the full list of <a href=#>2023 SAG Award nominees</a> — and look for the bold names to find out who
