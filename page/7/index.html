“I didn’t feel feel like dealing with the pregnancy rumors,” Hathaway, 35, told Glamour’s June/July issue. (She and her husband, Adam Shulman, are parents of son, Jonathan, 2.)
&nbsp;“I find it bizarre that there’s a storm to get ahead of,” she continued.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jamie Lynn Spears Family: Photos Hollywood Life</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

<a href=../../vanderpump-rules-ariana-madix-slammed-pretending-move-la-home.html></a>
ARIANA Madix has been facing backlash from fans for pretending to move out of her $2M Los Angeles home.
The Vanderpump Rules star and her cheating ex-boyfriend Tom Sandoval purchased the home in 2019.
On Monday, the 37-year-old posted an Instagram Story video that showed her standing outside her home with stacks of boxes behind her.
She captioned the post: "Ready to dip out," adding a smirking emoji.
Ariana and Tom, 39, called it quits in March after news broke that the Schwartz & Sandy's co-owner cheated with Vanderpump Rules co-star Raquel Leviss.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Your Sky TV box is set-up WRONG - simple change prevents annoying connection problems</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

Clint Eastwood didn’t want a performance. He wanted reality.
In his new thriller 15:17 to Paris, the Oscar-winning director depicts the story of three American friends — Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler — who stopped a terrorist attack on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris in August 2015.
And in an Eastwood first, he skipped the casting calls and relied on the now-heroes to star as themselves in the film.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Angela Deem Claims She Had to Fend Off Other Women's Husbands on 90 Day The Last Resort</h2><time>Sep 28, 2024</time>
