"Guys in their 20s don’t have a clue who they are as human beings.</p><p>“They know what they want to become — a doctor, a lawyer, a politician — but the proper study of one’s own self?</p><p>“Men don’t get around to that until their 30s or 40s, which is roughly 10 years later than most women, who seem to know exactly who they are.”</p><p>Two years after their <a href=#>divorce</a>, Bolton started dating <a href=#>Desperate Housewives star, Nicollette Sheridan</a>. Their <a href=#>relationship</a> lasted until 1995, but in 2005 they got back together and got engaged in March 2006.</p><p>However, it was confirmed they had broken off their engagement in August 2008.</p><h2>What is Michael Bolton’s net worth?</h2><p>Michael Bolton is estimated to have a <a href=#>net worth</a> of $80 million, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and the majority of his income has come from his career as a singer and songwriter.</p><p>Over the years he has pursued acting and appeared in the shows Meet Wally Sparks, Two and a Half Men, and was a contestant on Season 11 of <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>.</p><p>Bolton was also a co-director of the 2018 documentary American Dream: Detroit, which highlighted the economic comeback of Detroit.</p><p>However, despite his success, Bolton's finances took a hit in 1992 when he was sued by the R&B band the Isley Brothers, who claimed Bolton stole their song with his release of Love is a Wonderful Thing.</p><p>The brothers had released the same song with the same title in 1966.</p><p>In 1994, a Los Angeles <a href=#>court</a> ruled in favor of the Isley Brothers and Bolton had to pay $5 million.</p><p>After appealing the verdict, in 2001, the matter was finally settled for good and instead of Bolton having to pay $5 million himself, the brothers received $4.2 million from <a href=#>Sony</a> Music, $932,924 from Bolton, and $220,785 from Bolton's songwriter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000003947302.jpg><h2>How is Michael Bolton doing?</h2><p>On Friday, January 5, 2024, <a href=#>Michael gave a heartfelt note</a> to his fans that he would be taking a break from touring to focus on his recovery.</p><p>He made the announcement on his <a href=#>Facebook</a> page <a href=# rel=noopener>stating</a>: "Just before the holidays, it was discovered that I had a brain tumor, which required immediate surgery.
