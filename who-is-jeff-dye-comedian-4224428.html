Comedian Spotted Kissing Kristin Cavallari Hollywood Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jeff-dye-5-things-to-know-ap-images-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2>It’s only getting hotter between <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong></a> and <strong>Jeff Dye</strong>. The comedian, first spotted getting cozy with the reality star in Chicago, just joined her for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a romantic vacation</a> to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. And it’s clear that they’re living their best life in paradise. Kristin, 33, and Jeff, 37, were spotted making out, dancing, and even sharing a sweet hug on December 6 during their private getaway. This is the real deal! For those unfamiliar with Jeff, here’s the scoop on Kristin’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>new man</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. He hails from the Pacific Northwest.</strong> Jeff Dye is a “nationally touring comedian, actor, host, prankster, and Bigfoot enthusiast,” according to his website’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bio</a>. Jeff was raised in Seattle, Washington, with a “class clown” mentality. He began doing comedy at “Giggles Comedy Club right out of high school,” according to his bio, but he’s serious when it comes to comedy. Jeff’s true passion, per his bio, is “bringing love and positivity through laughter to everyone he encounters.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I feel very blessed that I always knew I wanted to be a comedian,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Moontower Comedy News </a>in 2018. “There was never a distraction period or a time of me thinking I needed to go pursue anything. I’ve always known I was going to be a comic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jeff-dye-5-things-to-know-ap-images-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. You may have seen him on TV.</strong> Jeff’s first taste of fame came in 2008 when he was a finalist on the sixth season of NBC’s Last Comic Standing (he finished third behind <strong>Marcus </strong>and winner <strong>Iliza Shlesinger</strong>.) The success landed him two hosting gigs for MTV – Numbnuts and Money From Strangers – and he also appeared on Girl Codes, Hollywood Game Night, I Can Do That!, and Lip Sync Battle. He was the “sidekick” role on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Better Late Than Never</a>, an NBC reality-travel show that took four “seasoned” celebrities – <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>William Shatner</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Henry Winkler</a>, George Foreman, </strong>and <strong>Terry Bradshaw</strong> <strong>– </strong>around the world with Jeff acting as the younger, sturdy guide.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“The show is so much fun, and we’re all very close,” Jeff told Moontower Comedy News when discussing Better Late Than Never. “It’s a dream job. There’s no way around that. I’m flying first class, all these beautiful places, and getting to do all these first-class things with four guys that I really like.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>3. He got steamy in Chicago with Kristin</strong>. Jeff instantly became the envy of The Hills fans when he was caught <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>making out with Kristin</a> in the Fulton Market district of Chicago, where one of her Uncommon James stores is located. Despite being in the middle of a crowded bar, Kristin and Jeff — then identified as a “mystery man” — were definitely only focusing on each other. Their PDA session came nearly six months after her split from her husband of seven years,<strong>Jay Cutler</strong>, and marked the first time she was spotted getting cozy with a guy in public! Since then, their romance has clearly blossomed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>4. Success didn’t come easily.</strong> “I was so bad in the beginning, it was embarrassing,” Jeff told Moontower. “Also, I was very much a part of the, as they call it in comedy, the Dane Wave. We all saw <strong>Dane Cook</strong> on TV, and then we were like, “Oh, I can do this.” Then we went down to the comedy club, and we’re all doing a horrible impression of Dane Cook, just big act outs and not a lot of formulated jokes as much as just a Dane Cook formula.” Jeff credits his breakthrough to a book by comedian and motivational speaker <strong>Judy Carter. </strong>“I took the same ideas that were bombing, even things that got no laughs, and that night I was getting laughs by just formulating them the correct way,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>5. He plays dumb.</strong> There’s clearly a brain in Jeff’s head. Not everyone can be a standup, but he’ll be the first one to say he’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer. “Everybody who knows me knows that I’m dumb. But they also know that I’m, like, the happiest guy in the world. And I’m probably happy because I’m dumb,” Jeff would say in his act, according to a 2017 post by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cleveland.com</a>. “You ever met a smart person? They’re always annoyed, always pissed off. I think they put all this learning in their brain, and then they don’t know what to do with it, and then that frustrates them. So they just walk around all day like, ‘Ahhhh, global warming. …. Gluten.’ “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3prLFZpuynV2YvK6xw6KYp2VkZ391gJFxZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shinees-key-worked-with-nct-rapper-for-his-second-album.html><span>←</span><span>SHINees KEY Worked With NCT Rapper For His Second Album</span></a>
