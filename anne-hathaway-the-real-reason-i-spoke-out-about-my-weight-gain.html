(She and her husband, <strong>Adam Shulman</strong>, are parents of son, Jonathan, 2.)</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>&nbsp;“I find it bizarre that there’s a storm to get ahead of,” she continued. “But I have a history of being shamed and humiliated, for a lot of different reasons.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hathaway experienced social media fallout following her 2013 Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress in Les Miserables. Some believed she seemed disingenuous when she exclaimed “It came true!” during her speech. “It’s like they took all the things that people find annoying and put them in one person,” wrote one individual on Twitter at the time. Added another: “Anne Hathaway reminds me of that kid in school that all the other kids didn’t really like but all the teacher loves.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hathaway reflected on that period in her life in a March Instagram post that showed her at the 2013 Academy Awards. She captioned the photo: I had to change my dress last minute and so it looked like my nipples were hard, I had full blown laryngitis and had to sing, and a bunch of corny haters were getting lots of attentions from the media for being haters but you know what? It was still the best.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hathaway’s The Hustle costar<a href=#><strong> Rebel Wilson</strong></a><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>wishes people knew the real “Annie.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Sometimes she’ll come out with a really good joke, and I’m like, ‘You should tweet that or put that on Instagram, Annie!’ And she’s like, ‘I can’t,’” Wilson, 38, revealed to Glamour. “One Friday I said, ‘I can taste the weekend,’ and she was like, ‘Oh, and how does he taste?’ She comes up with stuff like that all the time. I guess a lot of people don’t know that side of her.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While speaking with Glamour, the Oceans 8 star also got candid about how she used to deal with her anger. “I have a history with rage,” she admitted. “I used to do this thing where I was like, ‘I’m nice 29 days out of 39, and then I give myself complete permission to be a bitch to anyone, about anything.’” But one day, she had an important epiphany. “I realized that if I could actually move away from the judgement and deal with my emotions in that moment, I didn’t actually need the extra day. Rage doesn’t lead you to a place of peace. And for me the goal is not happiness. The goal is peace.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaapp6aeqmt06GYsJmpYsGpsYyrnJqkXaeyor%2FOp2SiZaOlvKyxjKisrWWRl7y2wIymsGavlZ60qcCMoJiipl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-maggie-leaving-chicago-med.html><span>←</span><span>'Chicago Med' Star Marlyne Barrett Could Be in Danger of Leaving the Series</span></a>
