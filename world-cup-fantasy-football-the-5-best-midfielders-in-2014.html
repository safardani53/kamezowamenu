76 points</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000108094031-e1528627368299.jpg><p>Thomas Muller continued his impressive habit of scoring for fun in World Cups, after he netted five in Germany's winning campaign in 2014.</p><p>The Bayern Munich man is expected to impress once again in Russia, in what is a formidable squad at Joachim Low's disposal.</p><p>Muller is now only six goals shy of the World Cup record number of goals set at 16 by Germany legend Miroslav Klose.</p><p>You can pick Muller in your&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Dream Team World Cup</a> side for £6m.</p><h3>3 Toni Kroos - 67 points</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000106682286-e1528627430142.jpg><p>Toni Kroos continues the theme of Germany players who bossed it at the World Cup in 2014.</p><p>The metronome midfielder was an ever present for Die Mannschaft in Brazil, scoring two goals and registering four assists in the tournament.</p><p>Kroos can be selected in your&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Dream Team World Cup</a> side for just £4m.</p><h3><a href=#>DREAM TEAM WORLD CUP <span>Click here to sign up for this summer's brilliant fantasy football game</span></a></h3><h3>4 Arjen Robben -

62 points</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000045016000.jpg><p>Andre Schurrle was one of the surprise packages at the 2014 World Cup.</p><p>The 27-year-old quickly became one of Germany's most important players at the tournament, scoring three and assisting three on route to the final.</p><p>Schurrle assisted Mario Gotze for his dramatic winner against Argentina which won Germany the World Cup.</p><p>Like Gotze, Schurrle is not available for selection in your&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Dream Team World Cup</a> side after he was omitted from Germany's 23-man squad by Low.</p><h3><strong>How does World Cup <a href=# rel=noopener>fantasy football</a> work?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ronaldo-fantasy.jpg><p>If you’re already a Dream Team fan you’ll recognise the setup.</p><p>The game is&nbsp;<strong>completely free to enter</strong>&nbsp;and will run from the opening game on<strong>&nbsp;June 14&nbsp;</strong>right up until when England inevitably lift the trophy in the final on&nbsp;<strong>July 15.</strong></p><p>Because that’s definitely what’s going to happen, right?</p><p>You will be given&nbsp;<strong>20 transfers</strong>&nbsp;at the start of the tournament to use across the duration, with a maximum of&nbsp;<strong>three transfers per match day.</strong></p><p>Our expert friends over at&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>WhoScored</a>&nbsp;– as they have for the Season and Weekender games – will provide all the statistics that generate the points scoring.</p><h3>How do you sign up?</h3><p>You can now officially&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>sign up</a>&nbsp;and start picking your teams after hundreds of thousands of you pre-registered in the last month or so.</p><p>You can sign up to play the game&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>&nbsp;</strong>and we recommend downloading the Dream Team app too so you’ve got all the latest news, gossip and updates at your finger tips.</p><h3><a href=#>DREAM TEAM WORLD CUP <span>Click here to sign up for this summer's brilliant fantasy football game</span></a></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX5m%2Fpq3MZquemZ1kg3WElnJqbWenpL%2BtsIycrKlllpa7ta3SsmSfp5%2Bpr6K4y2aroZ1danqjsdKtZKahlJu2prjDnqmsZZmjenN8kG1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danielle-illness-outdaughtered.html><span>←</span><span>What's Wrong With Danielle Busby?
