Their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first meeting</a> was at the side of a road when Cole helped Nave rescue her car when it was stuck at a snowbank. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>According to Cole, the first meet was enough for him to fall in love with her. A few hours after getting Nave's car out of the snowbank,&nbsp;he immediately followed her on Instagram and began sending her messages. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On the other hand, Nave wasn't interested in him at first. But as they slowly got to talking, she took a liking to him, and on February 5, 2019, they officially began dating.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, both of them have frequently&nbsp;been seen together. Cole and his girlfriend are both&nbsp;YouTubers. They often make&nbsp;appearances in each other's videos.</p><p>Understandably, the pair takes to social media to share wishes for&nbsp;each other on their birthdays and other special occasions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ten&nbsp;months into their relationship, on December 5, 2019, the girlfriend&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a> some&nbsp;memorable moments that she had shared with her doting boyfriend&nbsp;in the form of pictures and short clips.&nbsp;She accompanied the post with a&nbsp;heartfelt&nbsp;caption on&nbsp;the hard times they faced, the many things she learned with Cole's help, among others.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She concluded her caption by stating that she loved her bright and goofy best friend/boyfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Nave Regards Cole the Cornstar Her Best Friend</h2><p>Nave and Cole are&nbsp;not limited to being&nbsp;lovers;&nbsp;the Youtuber's girlfriend also sees&nbsp;him&nbsp;as her best friend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For instance, on July 18, 2020, when she became a legal motorcycle driver in Iowa state, she took the opportunity to share a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lovely picture</a> of her kissing her boyfriend with their motorcycles in the frame. Also, through the caption, she credited her "best friend" for the achievement, stating&nbsp;that she could not wait to plan motorcycle trips with him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram post</a> on September 3, 2020, she mentioned that when people asked her if Cole was her boyfriend or best friend, she replied&nbsp;that he was&nbsp;both. Nave has mentioned Cole as her best friend in several of her posts.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, it seems that the "best-friends" are not just going stronger but also becoming inseparable as time progresses.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Details On the Girlfriend</h2><p>Hneiva Uranga - Nave is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">21-year-old</a> girl from the suburbs of Iowa state.
