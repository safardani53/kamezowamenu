Athletics Commentator Net Worth Before Death</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>The death and obituary of Tony O Donoghue are being sought</strong> since he was an Irish sports commentator and Group Soccer Correspondent for RTÉ, Ireland’s top radio and television broadcaster. He covered live games for the Republic of Ireland, League of Ireland, UEFA Champions League, and English Premier League for RTÉ Television. On RTÉ, he also presented the Monday Night Soccer show on occasion.</p><p>O’Donoghue became well-known before the FIFA World Cup in Japan and Korea for his reportage on the events in Saipan that forced Ireland captain Roy Keane to leave the team’s camp. In an interview, Keane expressed his displeasure with the coach, the FAI, and the perplexing circumstances surrounding Stephen Ireland’s removal from the Ireland team under Steve Staunton. He has covered all important FAI-related events since the mid-’90s ticket controversies. Donoghue was the first sports news journalist for RTÉ Television News before becoming the program’s first group soccer correspondent.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tony-O-Donoghue-2.jpg alt="Tony O Donoghue" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He was a pundit and presenter for RTÉ’s two main radio sports shows, Saturday Two to Five and Sunday Sport, before entering the newsroom. In the 1980s, O’Donoghue worked as a music journalist for Hot Press and managed the Cork-based rock band Cypress Mine. He previously married Mary Wilson of RTÉ, with whom he had a daughter. He remarried in November 2013.&nbsp;On November 17, three days before the commencement of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, O’Donoghue was stopped by Qatari authorities while trying to film in the country.</p><h2>Tony O Donoghue Death And Obituary: What Caused the Athletics Commentator’s Death?</h2><p>Unfortunately, the news of Tony O Donoghue’s death is genuine, as several reputable sources have confirmed, and tributes to Tony have begun to emerge. However, the family did not divulge the reason for the death of Tony O Donoghue at the time of writing this article, hence no definitive explanation could be located on the internet.&nbsp;Nonetheless, after being diagnosed with cancer in 2011, Tony had a neck lump removed and had radiation and chemotherapy, suggesting that Tony O Donoghue’s death cause was cancer. This information has yet to be validated by authorities.</p><p>Tony’s family is going through a difficult time and has refused to divulge any further information about Tony O Donoghue’s death. Our role is to ensure that they have the privacy they need at this trying time.</p><h2>&nbsp;Tony O Donoghue’s Net Worth Before Death</h2><p>Tony kept his personal information, such as his net worth, to himself since the commentator had yet to divulge his actual net worth while he was with us. He died with an estimated net worth of more than $4 million, according to several estimates. Officials, however, have yet to corroborate this information.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tony-O-Donoghue-1.jpg alt="Tony O Donoghue" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tony did not have social media platforms like Instagram while he was alive, thus just a few details about his hobbies, lifestyle, and other interests were discovered when this article was published.&nbsp;Tony, on the other hand, had a Twitter account with the name @Corktod and had over 31k followers before his death. He usually tweeted about his employment and retweeted RTE Soccer and others.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKapYrxusM6npqCgpZp6sK7IrayaqqlitbDDjJ2gnWWYmnqltcRmmK2gnJrBqq%2FSZpqopZ2au7Wt06ipZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2aalZu8s7GMnZyarJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./project-runway-contestant-wendy-pepper-dies-at-53.html><span>←</span><span>Project Runway Contestant Wendy Pepper Dies at 53</span></a>
