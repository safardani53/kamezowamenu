He was seen in a first photo from the facility with his head completely shaved of its distinctive reddish hair, and wearing a bright yellow prison jumpsuit with a brass button. Alex appeared to be slightly smiling in the mugshot after he was convicted of killing his wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Margaret</strong>&nbsp;<strong>“Maggie” Murdaugh</strong></a>&nbsp;and son <strong>Paul&nbsp;</strong><strong>Murdaugh</strong> on June 7, 2021. After a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>guilty verdict was handed down</a> on Thursday, March 2, he was given<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> two life sentences</a> in the shooting deaths. Alex&nbsp;was also convicted of 2 counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alex-Murdaugh-1st-Prison-Photo-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The six-week trial, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>according to a juror</a>, culminated in a decision that took only 45 minutes to reach. H Juror <strong>Craig Moyer,&nbsp;</strong>a carpenter, explained how a decision on Alex’s guilt came about after only 45 minutes to an hour of deliberation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“The evidence was clear,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Good Morning America</a> during a March 3 interview, noting the video of Maggie and Paul taken the day they were killed. “You can hear his voice clearly, and everybody else could too.” Craig admitted to being “surprised” that Alex confessed it was him. “That was his only savior right there,” he said.&nbsp;The juror was also asked what made him sure of his decision. &nbsp;“His responses,” he remarked. “How quick he was with the defense and his lies. Steady lies. A good liar, but not good enough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-03-134423.png><p id=content-paragraph-5>Craig seemed to also be disturbed by the former attorney’s lack of remorse for the brutal crimes. “I didn’t think much of him,” he explained. “I didn’t see any true remorse or any compassion or anything. He never cried. All he did was blow snot. No tears. I saw his eyes.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for the eventual admission he was near the dog kennels where the murders happened, Alex previously apologized. “I did lie to them,” he said, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>USA Today</a>. “I don’t think I was capable of reason and I lied about being down there and I’m so sorry that I did.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e49sZpqkla16rsHRnZiun5hiwKmt1Z6bZqCVlrFufdKtZKmqmai8r3nPoaatp18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carol-vorderman-roger-teal-chipstead.html><span>←</span><span>'We need Carol Vorderman' - furious trainer stripped of 50,000 win jokes only maths genius can rid</span></a>
