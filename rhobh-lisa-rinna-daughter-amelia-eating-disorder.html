We’re going to UCLA [to get treatment]."</p><p>“And I was like, ‘Oh my God.’ And in that moment, I was like, ‘I’m going to rebel, like, they’re crazy.’ … We show up, it’s like this really scary old man’s office. … He looked at me and he was like, so yeah, basically at this rate in about four months, you’re going to be 45 pounds and you’re going to be dead.”</p><p>“I just snapped out of it. Like I was so lucky that I was just like, ‘Yeah, I don’t want to be 45 pounds. I’m not going to be, you know, this type of person, I’m not going to ruin my life because of whatever issues I’m having. You don’t need to be skinny to, like, live your best life.
