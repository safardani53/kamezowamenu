Epps) sat in an ambulance as a paramedic prepared to shut the door to transport him to an emergency room. In the background, a black sedan had collided with a barricade on the road’s shoulder. The entire front of the car was smashed.</p><p class=p1>A spokesperson for the Florida Highway Patrol confirmed to <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> on Saturday that a crash involving three vehicles occurred in Miami. The outlet reported that 2 Chainz’s car was struck by another vehicle, and the musician allegedly suffered neck injuries. Per TMZ, he is now in stable condition.</p><p class=p1>2 Chainz has been in Miami for the annual <a href=#>Art Basel</a> festival, stepping out at a party on Friday, December 8. Several hours later, he went to get dinner in South Beach at Marketplace 119.</p><p class=p1>“I had to come,” 2 Chainz said in a Friday Instagram Story video. “I can just pick out something fresh and you make it right here? You know I like that here. … I want [that] seafood. I don’t eat no beef or no pork. I like seafood.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2-Chainz-Taken-to-Hospital-After-Car-Crash-in-Miami-Rapper-Shares-Footage-From-Incident-2.jpg><p class=p1>2 Chainz rose to fame as a member of the hip hop duo Playaz Circle alongside <strong>Earl “Dolla Boy” Conyers</strong>, getting signed to <strong>Ludacris</strong>’ record label in the early 2000s. He later received a solo recording contract with Def Jam in 2012 and has earned six Grammy nominations for his music. He also owns several restaurants and nail salons.</p><p class=p1>“My daddy sold bricks and he sold weed. My mama’s mama, she was a bootleg lady. My mama was into real estate when I was young,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>XXL</i></a> magazine in March 2022 of his entrepreneurship. “Daddy never had a job. I never remember him getting up early. I never remember him complaining about being in traffic from coming home late from work. I don’t remember none of that. I remember Cadillacs and I remember my uncle having plenty of jewelry.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “I had an uncle who owned a liquor store. He employed all of my uncles. A lot of that stuff was just stuff that I was subconsciously peeping out. Like, how to do it by yourself. I’m a hustler as well. So, I know that just rap money wasn’t gon’ do it for me. I had to try to find multiple streams of income. Just try to diversify my portfolio.”</p><p class=p1>2 Chainz has been <a href=#>married to <strong>Kesha Ward</strong></a> since 2018 after he <a href=#>proposed at the Met Gala</a> that May. 2 Chainz and Ward, who have been together since 2006, share three kids: Heaven, Harmony and Halo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZrZZOdrqq62WarmqOVo3q1u4yhpqyomamurXnAn6ueql2YrrN5wquYrKBdnrtuuciapKJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kareem-jackson-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kareem Jackson Dating Now</span></a>
