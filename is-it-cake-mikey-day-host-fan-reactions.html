Contestants create hyper-realistic cakes that resemble either other food items, like hamburgers, or non-food things, like beach accessories or even clothing. Viewers love the concept, but what about the Is it Cake? host, <a href=#>Mikey Day</a>?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Mikey Day was already a member of the Saturday Night Live cast and known for his comedic timing before he was cast as the Is It Cake? host, there are a lot of fans who aren't wild about Mikey as the face of the series.</p><p>Some have taken to Twitter or TikTok to share their dislike of how he delivers lines or appears to be less than enthusiastic about his role on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are a lot of 'Is It Cake?' fan reactions to Mikey Day as the host.</h2><p>If you sift through all of the negative <a href=#>fan reactions</a> on social media regarding Mikey as the show's host, you can find some positive reviews. But right now, there are a number of thoughts about Mikey being, more often than not, incredibly annoying.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Some Is It Cake? fans love the show, but they actually want Netflix to fire Mikey as the host. It's a good thing for any Netflix reality competition series to get so much attention, but not when a good chunk of it is on the negative spectrum and directed toward Mikey.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mikey Day might the the worst host of a show ever! I’ve yet to laugh at one of his jokes great show but please change the host <a href=#>#IsItCake</a></p>— wood the coach 🏁 (@coachwood33) <a href=#>March 20, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another fan tweeted that they would have preferred a different host in Mikey's place. More specifically, according to the fan, Nicole Byer, who hosts Nailed It! on Netflix already. Whether you love Mikey as the Is It Cake? host or not, Nicole would have been a solid choice too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One viewer shared a TikTok video in which they called Mikey "repulsive" as the host and said that he can't tell if the jokes are "supposed to be satire or not." Honestly, that has to sting for a reality show host who is also a comedian.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course there are Is It Cake? viewers who enjoy watching Mikey as the host. He certainly isn't a nobody and he has experience working an audience. But there seem to be far more opinions against him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The host for <a href=#>#IsItCake</a> on Netflix is ao exhaustingly annoying 😩😩😩😩 what's with all the theatrics??</p>— Yam Yami 🐞 (@Intemnandi) <a href=#>May 9, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But there are those who like the show who still aren't totally sold on the host. Maybe Mikey's strategy is to appear corny and deliver silly cake puns on purpose. But a lot of viewers aren't here for it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another viewer posted a video on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> from Is It Cake? and called Mikey "a menace to society." In the words of Alicia Silverstone as Cher a la Clueless, that's way harsh.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Im sorry Mikey Day should never host anything cause baby watching him on <a href=#>#isitcake</a> is cringy 😫 I think it’s the voice 😫🤦🏾‍♀️</p>— 🤙🏾🌟I'sha🤙🏾🌟 (@ohhshytitzwelz) <a href=#>August 30, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some 'Is It Cake?' fans do like Mikey Day as the host.</h2><p>For what it's worth, those Is It Cake? fans who might have had the ick when the show began didn't really sway Netflix in getting rid of the host. And that could be because there are still viewers who like his quirky sense of humor and enjoy Mikey as the host.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I thought <a href=#>#IsItCake</a> would be a corny show but I love these people and Mikey is so silly</p>— THE ROCK’S WIFE (@11ASILAJ) <a href=#>June 7, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The issue could just be that viewers needed time to warm up to Mikey as the host. Sure, there are still some naysayers left over from when the serious originally dropped on Netflix. But after Season 2 premiered, more fans were ready to accept the trust host.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Mikey might not be winning many fan points as the host of Is It Cake? but viewers are still eating up each episode.
