While his impressive chameleon-like ability is lauded, his constant change has caused many debates on social media over plastic surgery and facelift rumors.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The comedian flaunts his fit physique on Instagram and has even gone on record to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deny</a> getting surgery. He&nbsp;credits his athletic body to a healthy lifestyle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, experts seem to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">disagree</a>.&nbsp;They&nbsp;believe that Cook has undergone minor cosmetic procedures over the years.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>More recently, the sight of Cook sporting a distinct dad-bod on&nbsp;social media&nbsp;has got his fans wondering about the drastic changes in his physique. Did he get heavy for another Hollywood role, or did he just put on a few pounds?&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He put his fans’ qualms to rest with a clarification in his recent Instagram post.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Dane Cook On Playing a Dad</h2><p>In the&nbsp;post, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled</a>&nbsp;some of his roles, which have included everything from a sabotaging best friend in&nbsp;My Best Friend’s Girl&nbsp;to lending his voice for an endearing crop-dusting airplane in&nbsp;Planes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cook iterated that he transformed&nbsp;his body to tell a different story. The warrior-type figure for&nbsp;Retaliation, or&nbsp;in&nbsp;Mr. Brooks,&nbsp;where he gained 30 pounds and didn’t wash his face to represent Mr. Smith, a guy “who had no moral or nutritional limitations.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, all these roles have had one thing in common, his face. It was the only thing that did not change. In his recent thriller release,&nbsp;American Exit,&nbsp;the actor purposefully gained about 30 pounds for a role in which he plays a dying father&nbsp;who kidnaps his teenage son. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cincinnati</a>, he explained,</p><p>&nbsp;I was&nbsp;about&nbsp;200 pounds at the time. It’s literally two years later, and I realized, oh wow, as you get older, you can’t just burn that 30 pounds off as easily.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Cook kept the weight on for a subsequent role, but it ended up getting canceled as the world went into lockdown following the outbreak of Covid-19. Since then, Cook has been working hard to drop the extra pounds and get back in shape.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dane Cook Credits Swimming Workouts</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>actor</a> revealed that he was preparing for the celebration of his 30 years in comedy. He gave fans a glimpse of not only his slimmed-down physique and but also shared his latest health and fitness journey. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Cook's&nbsp;latest fitness secret is tethered swimming.</p><p>The actor claimed it was the most incredible workout he’s ever done, and it was more than a cardio burn for him. Aside from burning “1000 calories a day,” he finds the workout meditative and&nbsp;claiming. It has&nbsp;changed his physicality and his thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Cook promises to continue committing to transforming his body for his career and health.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It does not matter if they cast him to play a ‘portly bank robber’ or ‘heavyset alien general,’ because he will continue to rely on swimming for the best burn.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiaqKWVmbaiuo6dmKedXZi8sLeMrKyrn5Wnxm%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samantha-logans-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Samantha Logan Dating Samantha Logan's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
