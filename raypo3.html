However, she hasn’t revealed her earnings. <strong>As of November 2023, Raypo3’s net worth is estimated to be $4 million.</strong></p><h2>Career</h2><p>On August 3rd, mother Rachel posted a video to her TikTok @raypo3 account where her husband dances with their nanny, whom they presumably hire and pay appropriately. She demonstrates what occurs “when dad gets home before the nanny departs” in the film before displaying a succession of clips that have received a lot of backlashes online.</p><p>Lizzie first takes up her father. Then he lifts her and twirls her around, brushing her against her breast. They then attempt the famous Dirty Dancing routine in which Baby rushes into Johnny Castle’s arms, portrayed by Patrick Swayze. The video, however, does not stop there. They practice the Dirty Dancing routine repeatedly until they get it perfect, with the wife cheering them on from behind the camera.</p><p>Rachel’s TikTok account, where she uploads material about her husband, two children, and nanny under the name @raypo3, is where the video first became viral. She has about 95,000 followers, and the “Dirty Dancing” video has 7.2 million views. The TikTok video was also uploaded by “The Best Loved Nanny,” an account that provides advice and conversation points for prospective nannies and has been watched 5.3 million times.</p><h2>Raypo3 Husband & Marriage</h2><p><strong>Who is Raypo3’s Husband?</strong> Raypo3 is married to Andrew, and she is the mother of two children. She is very private about her personal life and relationship. She has not revealed any information about her husband and relationship.
