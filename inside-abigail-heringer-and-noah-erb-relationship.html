Erb shared a picture of the couple sipping grapefruit Palomas.</p><p>“Happy 9 Month Anniversary BB,” he wrote in the caption. “In a world full of game boy colors, you’re a backlit game boy advanced.”</p><p>Without a doubt, the couple is enjoying the time of their life dating one other right now. Their relationship, however, had a difficult start.</p><h2>‘Bachelor in Paradise’ stars Abigail Heringer and Noah Erb.</h2><p>Through Bachelor in Paradise, Heringer and Erb’s relationship became public knowledge. However, their voyage on the program was not without incident.&nbsp;Erb stated that he had his eyes set on Heringer even before the shooting started. They looked to be going strong during their time on the beach, but concerns and reluctance caught up with them. Erb had doubts since he wasn’t sure whether he had found the one yet, and Heringer had doubts because she didn’t respond when Erb indicated he was falling in love with her.&nbsp;Despite being named “Most Likely to Live Happily Ever After” at the ’80s-themed prom night, the Bachelorette alum took Heringer aside to call it quits.</p><p>“I’ve been trying to manufacture something that I desire when I know deep down that I haven’t found my person,” he stated tearfully.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Abigail-Heringer-2.jpg alt="Abigail Heringer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Erb’s explanation caught Heringer off guard. “You go from telling someone you’re falling in love with them the night before to this discussion,” she said, perplexed. She then charged him with making false promises. Following the altercation, the two departed Paradise separately before the prom. However, this was not the end of their on-screen love.&nbsp;Heringer and Erb were then shown to be hanging out and taking things gently in the finale, according to cast updates.</p><h2>Abigail Heringer Began Dating Boyfriend Noah Erb</h2><p>Despite their divorce on the program, the pair were dating again in real life.&nbsp;Heringer, on the other hand, was drawn into Clare Crawley and Dale Moss’ ugly divorce. There were speculations that she had an affair with Moss. The reports, however, were false since Heringer and Erb were dating at the time.&nbsp;The next month, he responded to the allegation on his Instagram story, adding that there were a lot of exciting things going on on social media. Heringer’s laughing could be heard in the background, according to Bachelor Nation viewers.</p><p><br>And the realization didn’t take long. In October 2021, the couple revealed their courtship with charming Instagram photos.</p><p>Heringer shared a video of the pair enjoying outdoor sports, messing about, and kissing near a waterfall set to Miley Cyrus’ ‘Adore You.’ “I adore you @noah erb,” she said in the post. Erb also shared an Instagram video of the occasion, which had Ellie Goulding’s “How Long Will I Love You” playing in the background.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Abigail-Heringer-3.jpg alt="Abigail Heringer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“You never know what you’ve had until it’s gone, and then you never let it go,” he captioned the picture. “I love you @abigail heringer, here’s to laughing our way through life till we’re elderly,” he said.&nbsp;He clarified the situation in the same post, emphasizing that Heringer was his new girlfriend.&nbsp;Since then, the couple has been posting updates about their life on social media. The pair was in a long-distance relationship until February 2022, and they even gave followers long-distance advice.&nbsp;According to Bachelor Nation, Heringer had already gone to California for her partner by March 2022. And their connection has been continuing strong, as seen by their social media postings.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigp6uZmbJurcGinpqhnGK1pr7Ip56eql2Wu6V5zaiYoWWVp69uvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ford-cosworth-sale-auction.html><span>←</span><span>Iconic Ford Sierra RS Cosworth up for sale at auction - less than 24 hours to go to pick up a bargai</span></a>
