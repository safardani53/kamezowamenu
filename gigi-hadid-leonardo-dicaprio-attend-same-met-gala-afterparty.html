The see-through look consisted of a corset and skirt attached with mesh fabric and completed with a pearl necklace and bejeweled accessories.</p><p>Hadid — who shares daughter <a href=#>Khai</a>, 2, with ex <a href=#><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></a> — later traded in one all-black look for another, arriving <a href=#>at the afterparty</a> in a long leather coat. DiCaprio, for his part, also sported the same color palette, as he was photographed <a href=#>wearing a black baseball cap</a>, blazer, pants and face mask upon entering the nightclub.</p><p>The duo first <a href=#>sparked romance rumors</a> in September 2022, one month after he and ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Camila Morrone</strong></a> split after <a href=#>four years of dating</a>. “Leo does have his sights set on Gigi, but she hasn’t shown an interest,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time. “They’re friends, but she doesn’t want to be romantic with [him] right now.”</p><p>That same month, the pair were spotted hanging out at a New York Fashion Week afterparty and were seated at the same table as <a href=#><strong>Venus Williams</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ben Simmons</strong></a>, <a href=#>according to an eyewitness</a>.</p><p>Gigi’s father, <strong>Mohamed Hadid</strong>, gave the <a href=#>Titanic</a> star <a href=#>his stamp of approval</a> amid news of the former couple’s budding romance. “I met Mr. DiCaprio in St. Tropez four or five years ago and he is a very nice man,” the real estate developer, 74, told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> in September 2022. “I liked him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gigi-Hadid-and-Ex-Leonardo-DiCaprio-Spark-Reconnection-Rumors-After-Arriving-at-Same-2023-Met-Gala-After-Party-inline.jpg><p>One month into their relationship, another source told Us that Gigi and DiCaprio were “<a href=#>very into each other</a> and are seeing where things go,” though they were “not serious by any means.” Their fling, however, <a href=#>came to an end in February</a>, as a different insider noted that “things just organically tapered off between them.”</p><p>“Leo and Gigi were at different points in their life, and it just didn’t work out between the two of them,” the source added.</p><p>Their Met Gala afterparty appearance marks the latest of several public reunions between the two. The <a href=#>Next in Fashion</a> cohost and the <a href=#>Don’t Look Up</a> star attended a <a href=#>mutual friend’s birthday party</a> in February, as well spent time together at an <a href=#>Oscars Weekend</a> party in Los Angeles.</p><p>“Leo and Gigi were hanging out together all night,” an eyewitness told Us of their <a href=#>awards season outing</a>. “There was no PDA, but they never left each other’s side.”</p><p>A separate shared more details about their possible reconnection in March, telling Us that while Gigi and DiCaprio <a href=#>“are into each other,”</a> Gigi is looking for more than just “a quick fling.”[She’s] torn because she has a lot of fun with Leo,” the insider added. “And while everyone hopes Leo will eventually settle down, everyone knows his past.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to DiCaprio’s love life, the <a href=#>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a> actor is known for often <a href=#>dating younger models</a>, such as <a href=#><strong>Nina Agdal</strong></a>, <strong>Kelly Rohrbach</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Toni Garrn</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Erin Heatherton</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Anne Vyalitsyna</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong></a> and more.</p><p>Morrone, 25, previously weighed in on her and her ex’s large age gap — as she is 23 years his junior — telling the Los Angeles Times in 2019, “I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagoZeeeqmtw6KbZqSVpLuivsOoZJ2hk5a9s7XOZpitrJWjsW6%2FwKacZqWVqXqorcuaZJqepJq%2Fsa3RrbBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-chloe-melas-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Chloe Melas Dating Now</span></a>
