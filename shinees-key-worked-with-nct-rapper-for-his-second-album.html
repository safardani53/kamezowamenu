<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>SHINees KEY Worked With NCT Rapper For His Second Album</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>SHINee’s KEY</strong> released the long-awaited tracklist for his second full-length album, Gasoline, on August 18 KST. The 11-track soundtrack drew notice for its overlapping ‘Lab Note’ idea and scribbles, but it also surprised fans of K-pop group NCT. For the single VILLAIN, the veteran K-pop star partnered with NCT’s Jeno.&nbsp;Fans are understandably enthusiastic about the duo’s collaboration since SHINee’s KEY is well-known for going all-in on his solo albums. They were overjoyed to find that the well-known artist had cooperated with the NCT rapper on his new album. VILLAIN was also previously seen at KEY’s Beyond Live: GROKS solo performance last year.</p><h2>SHINee’s KEY has revealed the tracklist for his second full-length album, Gasoline.</h2><p>Gasoline is KEY’s first solo release in over a year, after his equally explosive mini-album BAD LOVE. Due to the fact that this is the SHINee member’s second full-length album, the idol stunned fans with a leveled-up concept design that brought Halloween closer to them.&nbsp;SM Entertainment published the Gasoline tracklist on August 18. Gasoline, Bound, Villain (with JENO of NCT), Burn, Guilty Pleasure, G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time), I Can’t Sleep, Ain’t Gonna Dance, Another Life, Delight, and Proud are among the album’s 11 songs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SHINees-KEY-1.jpg alt="SHINee’s KEY" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>KEY from SHINee wrote the lyrics for four of the 11 songs on the list, including the title single, Gasoline. The title track will be a confident song that compares the idol-entertainer forging ahead on his own way to the strength of gasoline.&nbsp;The tracklist was scribbled on a notebook with heartbeats, scientific experiments, thunder, heart, fire, and other symbols. The images matched the vintage atmosphere teaser that was posted previously.</p><p>SHINee’s KEY has frequently discussed his passion for the nostalgia for the good ol’ days of the 1980s and 1990s throughout his BAD LOVE period. His prior solo CD was likewise influenced by it.&nbsp;This time, Gasoline takes the vintage sci-fi a step farther by playing many characters. He is a hero, a crazy scientist, an evil ruler, and what seems to be an explorer, all dressed up in vintage sci-fi settings, graphics, and performances.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>KEY 키 The 2nd Album 〖Gasoline〗 Mood Sampler – Chapter 2</p><p>➫ 2022.08.30. 6PM (KST)<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#키</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#KEY</a><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#샤이니</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#SHINee</a><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Gasoline</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pOW9R2Jyjr</a></p><p>— SHINee (@SHINee) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 16, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>KEY 키 The 2nd Album 〖Gasoline〗 Schedule Poster</p><p>➫ 2022.08.30. 6PM (KST)<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#키</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#KEY</a><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#샤이니</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#SHINee</a><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Gasoline</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/voR3DG17Tl</a></p><p>— SHINee (@SHINee) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2022</a></p><h2>What Next For gasoline?</h2><p>The originally announced Gasoline schedule has question marks on August 19.
