Young and Hannah are said to have “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bonded over their activism</a>.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Neil’s biggest passion in life is the environment. Daryl is the exact same,” a source told PEOPLE following their secret wedding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hannah, who famously dated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>John F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, had never been married prior to Young. However, the former Buffalo Springfield member had been previously married to<strong> </strong>Susan Acevedo and Pegi Young.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Young and Hannah went public not long after the singer’s marriage to Pegi ended in 2014. “When we got together, even some of my good friends were negative about it, and I could never understand it,” Young <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>recalled in an interview with Yahoo!

That’s all I was thinking.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Grammy winner added that he and Hannah were “very lucky to have found each other.

The sighting came two months after Young filed for divorce from his wife, Pegi,<strong> </strong>after 36 years of marriage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A source told PEOPLE that September that Hannah and Young had been “dating for months.” The source said, “They’ve taken no effort to even hide it. He recorded a new album a few weeks ago, and she was on Skype the entire time, giving him feedback on every take. He even told people in the studio she was his ‘girlfriend.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hannah was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>described as a friend of Young’</a>s in a 2013 HuffPost story about the duo filming a documentary in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.

The singer married his first wife Susan Acevedo in 1968, and his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>second wife, the late Pegi Young, in 1978</a>. He welcomed two children with Pegi before their divorce in 2014.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-young-had-a-secret-wedding></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Young had a secret wedding</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple privately wed in 2018. Hannah <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sparked marriage rumors</a> when she posted a photo of an owl on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram</a> along with the caption, “Someone’s watching over us… love & only love,” referencing the lyrics to Young’s “Love and Only Love.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Patricia Arquette</a><strong> </strong>commented on the picture, “You are the whisperer to all the animals… birds and bees follow you and protect you,” adding, “What a beautiful time of love and magic.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, on Facebook, guitarist Mark Miller <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>congratulated the couple</a>. “Congratulations to Daryl Hannah and Neil Young on their wedding today,” Miller wrote. “May they have a long and happy relationship."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ron Fugere, a local boat captain in the San Juan islands, told PEOPLE that he watched a “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>small, intimate gathering</a>” take place on the singer’s 1913 vintage boat, the W.N. Ragland, on July 27, 2018. The following month, Hannah and Young <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>reportedly held a second wedding ceremony</a> with 100 guests at Santa Margarita Ranch in San Luis Obispo, California.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-young-confirmed-their-marriage-on-his-website></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Young confirmed their marriage on his website</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>marriage was confirmed</a> by the musician in October 2018. Sharing an official live video of his band’s song “Ohio” on his website, Young referred to Hannah as “my wife Daryl” in a message calling for “common sense gun laws,” which came days after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>11 people were killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“ ‘Ohio’ was written back in 1970 after seeing the cover of a magazine with a young girl kneeling beside her fallen friend,” Young began. “When the National Guard murdered four students at Ohio’s Kent State University for protesting the Vietnam War, it was a pivotal moment in our history. It was a pivotal moment for me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Today we see what we have become,” he continued. “With no real laws protecting us from guns, and with politicians supporting the NRA because the NRA supports them, we are not well represented.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Young called today’s students “brave” by “demanding change in violent times.” He wrote, “We stand with them. They are us. We are them. This has been going on for far too long. My wife Daryl and I put this video together for you to reflect on.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-became-a-stepmother-upon-her-marriage-to-young></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She became a stepmother upon her marriage to Young</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Daryl Hannah Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Hannah and Young don’t have any children together, Hannah became a stepmother when she married Young. The “Harvest Moon” singer shares son Ben and daughter Amber with his second wife, Pegi. Young is also said to have a son named Zeke, his eldest child, from his relationship with Carrie Snodgress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Young’s son Ben, who has cerebral palsy, joined his dad and Hannah at the premiere of Paradox at the 2018 SXSW Conference and Festivals.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-once-dated-jfk-jr></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She once dated JFK Jr.</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shutterstock</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Long before marrying Young, Hannah was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>linked to famous faces</a> like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>David Blaine</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Val Kilmer</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Jackson Browne</a> and John F.
