I am at a loss for words. I never thought in a million years I would be writing this," she wrote in the first of her many tributes to the actor. "Cam, you were one of a kind. My heart will be forever broken. I am so happy that I got to spend almost everyday with you on set, you gave the best hugs. I wish I would have hugged you tighter when I saw you a couple of months ago."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She went on to thank the late Bunk'd actor for being like a family member to her.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you so much for being the big brother I never had...
