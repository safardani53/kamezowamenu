A source <a href=#>confirmed to <i>Us Weekly </i>at the time<i> </i></a>that the two women met at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in June and developed a friendship. Amid their divorces, their bond eventually turned romantic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sophia-Bush-and-Soccer-Star-Ashlyn-Harris-Spotted-Together-at-Art-Basel-Miami-Beach-1.jpg><p class=p3>“It’s only been a couple of weeks since their first official date, but things already feel really natural between them,” a second source told <i>Us </i>in October. “They love being together. They love sports and want to do good in the world.”</p><p class=p3>The insider noted that Bush and Harris had “instant chemistry” after they met but maintained that they didn’t start dating until their breakups. Bush <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Hughes, 42, in August after 13 months of marriage, nearly two months before Harris petitioned to <a href=#>end her own marriage</a>.</p><p class=p3>Harris and fellow soccer star Krieger, 39, were married for four years and share <a href=#>daughter Sloane, 2, and son Ocean, 14 months</a>. Following their breakup, USWNT fans speculated that the divorce was a result of infidelity, which Harris fervently denied.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“Not all marriages last forever. Ours did not. For many reasons,” Harris wrote in <a href=#>a lengthy Instagram statement last month</a>. “Let me be clear: I did not step out on my marriage. I was always faithful in my marriage, if not always totally happy.”</p><p class=p3>Harris concluded that the pair’s main focus moving forward is Sloane and Ocean. “My priority is being a good coparent to them with Ali,” she stressed. “Despite this current darkness, there have been years of love between us. And our kids are the best part of it all. They deserve two healthy and happy parents, and that’s what matters most. We are all in pain.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6CdtqJ5wa6qoWWRo7FurdKho7KmXZ2us77IrGSsqJ%2BpwaawjK2moJ2knbKzecCtZJqqpGKvor%2FEpWSipl2itqK5yGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maximilian-davis-a-designer-appointed-as-salvatore-ferragamo-creative-director.html><span>←</span><span>Maximilian Davis A Designer Appointed As Salvatore Ferragamo Creative Director</span></a>
