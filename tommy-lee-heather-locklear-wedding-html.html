The Melrose Place actress flaunted a fitted, mermaid-style gown.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>here’s a pic of my grandpa, Tommy lee & heather locklear when they got married in the 80sðŸ¤ª<br>he was their photographer, i have the original pictures, how cool! â¤ï¸ <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/2pECyTOqW1</a> — amberrrr (@amberstfu___) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 17, 2020</a></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The couple had a nondenominational ceremony, too, which lasted around 40 minutes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It was followed by the couple’s first kiss as a married couple. They then released a dozen white doves.</p><p>“It’s so exciting. I can’t believe it’s all happening,” Locklear said while sipping champagne before the reception.</p><p>After the grand wedding, the couple reportedly&nbsp;embarked on a three-week honeymoon in the Cayman Islands. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Speaking with People, Lee also stated that he was looking forward to&nbsp;growing old together with Locklear.</p><p>“I think we’ll be the coolest grandma and grandpa in the world. We’ll be like 85 or 90; I’ll still be a rock pig, and Heather will still be gorgeous,” he said.</p><h2>Many Claimed Tommy Lee and Heather Locklear Were a Strange Match</h2><p>While the couple and their close ones were celebrating the wedding, many, on the other hand, claimed that&nbsp;Lee and&nbsp;Locklear were a strange match. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Reporting the same, Entertainment Weekly’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 1996 report</a> read: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The marriage confounded gossip hounds. What did the squeaky-clean Locklear, 24, see in the 23-year-old rocker, who resembled nothing so much as a spider with badly teased hair? Her answer, an allusion to the supposedly satanic content of Crue’s songs: ‘Tommy doesn’t worship the devil; he worships me.’</p><p>Similarly, the March 2019 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">report by Popsugar</a> also described the&nbsp;mismatch, saying&nbsp;Lee was in the prime of his edgy rock-and-roll lifestyle while&nbsp;Locklear was one of Hollywood’s favorite TV ingenues — when they got married.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>The Couple Separated Seven Years Later</h2><p>Yes,&nbsp;the couple was a mismatch, but even they might have never wished Lee and&nbsp;Locklear to grow apart.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But they eventually did. The two ended their marriage after seven years of marriage in 1993.</p><p>Most reports cited the main reason for the divorce was “Lee’s ill-concealed on-the-road philandering.” However, the former couple made no comments regarding the reason for their separation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But&nbsp;Locklear said, “I’m not devastated or destroyed. It’s mostly just sad,” after&nbsp;the collapse of the marriage.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After divorce, Lee got married to actress and Playboy Playmate Pamela Anderson. But their on-and-off marriage ended in the late 2000s. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also got engaged to a few women, including&nbsp;model Bobbie Brown, dancer Mayte Garcia, and Greek-German singer Sofia Toufa.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He is now settled with his&nbsp;girlfriend-turned-wife,&nbsp;Furlan, a&nbsp;social media celebrity. They married on February 14, 2019.</p><p>On the other hand, Locklear&nbsp;is currently together with her fiancé, Chris Heisser.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyforq6ecuenGaglZbBqbHRZqOom5uhsqK%2BjLCcnZyZo7RvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sybil-smith.html><span>←</span><span>Sybil Smith</span></a>
