become rather cold next week with lower-than-average temperatures across much of the UK, accentuated by brisk easterly winds in the south.&nbsp;</p><p>“As the prevailing weather conditions will be

weather forecast.</p><p>You can also look for clues on road conditions such as ice on the pavement or on your windscreen before you start your journey and take extra care.</p><p>National Highways and the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland look after motorways and major A roads, and local authorities look after all the other roads, working as hard as they can to keep their networks clear during severe weather.

You should drive with care and respect the road conditions wherever you drive, but if you cannot avoid driving on a minor road, take extra care</li><li>Only travel if really necessary. Snow ploughs are unable to get through if the road or motorway is full of stationary traffic, so do not make journeys unless completely necessary to give National Highways and local authorities the space they need to help you on your journey</li><li>Avoid steep hills and exposed roads hills and exposed areas are likely to present more challenging driving conditions in snow and ice</li></ul><p>Make necessary preparations before you set off:</p><ul><li>Clear your windscreen of snow, frost or condensation. The Highway Code stipulates you must be able to see out of every glass panel in your vehicle</li><li>Clear any snow off the roof of the vehicle before you drive away, otherwise you may cause snow to fall on your windscreen hampering your vision.
