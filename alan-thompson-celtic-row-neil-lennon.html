Thommo, 46, was sacked as first-team coach during Lennon's first spell as Hoops manager eight years ago.
The Geordie's axing over his alleged off-field lifestyle damaged his seemingly unbreakable bond with long-term pal Lennon.
It also brought a sour end to his love affair with the club, where he won eight trophies as a player from 2000-07."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Yes, absolutely.</p><p>"He's got his reasons, I've got mine.

I was having a tough time personally and then it was tough after that because I was out of work and going through a divorce which was a tough time.</p><p>"I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I've come through it now and looking forward to the future."</p><p>Former Hoops idol Thompson - who lifted the Scottish Cup and SPL title during his time as coach - believes Lennon has matured since returning to Parkhead.</p><p>He said: "I think in his first period he made a lot of mistakes in terms of his anger on the touchline, his mannerisms and stuff like that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000003301308.jpg><p>"I think he's gone to Bolton and Hibs and watched Brendan come in and how he held himself in the touchline.</p><p>"He's probably sat back himself and thought, 'that's an impressive way to come across to the fans and the players' and it rubs off on the players.</p><p>"I think Lenny has mellowed, without a doubt. I think he's a lot more calm on the touchline. I don't know what he's like in the dressing room now, maybe he's more calm there.</p><p>"I think it's for the better. I think he's a better manager for the experience that he's had."</p><p>Thompson has been out of work since leaving Bury his assistant manager role at Bury in 2017.</p><p>But the former England international believes he's got unfinished business at Celtic and says he'd happily work in Scotland again.</p><p>He said: "Yeah, you could say that but then who knows what lies ahead, we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>"It'd be nice to get back in the game in some capacity, coaching and possibly managing in the future.</p><p>"You'd love to go back to any club that's got the stature of Celtic and the support.</p><p>"I've seen a lot of Celtic fans in the last few years at functions and stuff like that.</p><p>"They are great to be around and it's nice to get a pat on the back now and again because sometimes you forget about that in the dark days.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ in football</h2></p><p>"If the right job came up in the right part of Scotland and it was appealing to me, yeah I'd go back, without a doubt.</p><p>"It's a great place, great people.
