Fans have their theories.</h2><p>Of the many players active within the heist, Hannah Kim (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tati Gabrielle</a>) is perhaps one of the most cunning. Though initially presented as the head of security at SLS — the security firm guarding the $7 billion vault — she is also revealed to be Leo's daughter. She even shows a vested interest in the heist and wants in on the gig as a player with key insider information.</p><p>But as if trying to pull off one of the greatest heists in history wasn't enough stress, a baby comes into the mix.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the heist, Hannah discovers that she is pregnant. It's this shocking news that leads Hannah to stake a claim on the heist. Several months after the job is completed, she has successfully given birth and introduces Leo to his granddaughter, Lily.</p><p>While the show makes attempts to tie up as many loose ends as possible by the time the heist is over, the identity of Hannah's baby daddy is never actually addressed. However, fans have formulated theories.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a>, one fan posited that the father could be FBI agent Samuel Toby (Bubba Weiler). According to this theory, Samuel is noticeably dodgy about putting himself in danger. After the death of his partner, Nazan Abbasi (Niousha Noor), he is also seen packing a stuffed animal, something that he might offer a child upon seeing them.</p><p>Another person posited that the father was the son of Roger Salas (Rufus Sewell), though another person rebutted that he was far too young.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>One other viewer even theorized that the father could be Roger himself, citing the fact that in one episode, Hannah had an affair with someone at work who is never actually revealed. Of course, many of these are just working theories that are very open to debate. The truth is that there's no clear answer as to who Hannah's baby daddy could be.</p><p>If you want to judge for yourself, Kaleidoscope is now streaming on <a href=#>Netflix</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6vusChZJuZkq56p63ToZyrZZuWuaa1w6iqnKegmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fareed-zakaria-19640120-html.html><span>←</span><span>Fareed Zakaria (Journalist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
