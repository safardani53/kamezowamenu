She was the only one there without her spouse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0804_thelastresort_supertease_10_angeladeem_michaelilesanmi-1024x576.png><p>“At least he was there, you know,” Angela said of Michael’s long-distance participation.</p><p>“But at the end what really got me at the end of the night,” she remarked.</p><p>Angela said that “when everybody got to go home or into the hotels with their partners or at least beside their partners, I didn’t.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“That’s when the trouble really came,” Angela added ominously.</p><p>She said that this was “because I’ve had everybody’s husbands on my back porch and all the women getting their beauty sleep.”</p><p>Angela expressed: “I’m like, what the hell’s going on here?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0804_thelastresort_supertease_07_angeladeem_michaelilesanmi-1024x576.png><p>“I can’t even worry about my own relationship,” Angela joked.</p><p>She said that this was “because I’m turning into Mee-maw now.”</p><p>Angela added: “You know, I finally had to put a stop to it and say hey, get your friggin’ husbands, I’m trying to work on my relationship, my husband.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0804_thelastresort_supertease_09_angeladeem-1024x576.png><p>As Michael allegedly grew jealous as she spent time with these men, she found herself envying other couples.</p><p>“It was sad and I didn’t let the couples know a lot,” she expressed.</p><p>Angela went on: “I did say a little bit about it because they would fight and argue and I’m like, you people don’t get it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/0726_thelastresort_angeladeem.png><p>“Y’all are together, y’all can fix this is you want it — we’re apart and we’re trying to fix it, you know?” Angela said.</p><p>She complained: “At night it was very, very very hard for me. It was very lonely, it was.” &nbsp;</p><p>One truly remarkable takeaway from this interview is that Angela said that she went into the show believing that her atrocious behavior was somehow justified. It is not. Her actions have been abhorrent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/Angela-Deem-Fight-01.gif><p>“I had triggers. I never even knew what that word meant,” Angela admitted.</p><p>She said: “I bitch and raised hell because I get triggers, especially from my husband Michael, like, he’ll trigger me because he lies so much.”</p><p>Ah yes. Angela treats him this way because he makes her so angry? That’s pretty standard to hear from abusers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/1128_angeladeem_02-1024x576.png><p>Angela went on: “And little lie, big lie, doesn’t matter to me. You know, some people will just say it’s a little lie, to me a lie is a lie, like, we all lie, right?”</p><p>She rambled: “Like a bill collector says we need your rent or your furniture bill and you say, ‘Oh, something happened, I have to go to a funeral.'”</p><p>Angela’s oddly specific example continued: “But to me that’s not a lie because it’s something, it’s not hurting nobody, but when you lie to someone you love, that makes me furious.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/Angela-Deem-Fight-02.gif><p>“I never fully realized we have a miscommunication problem, honestly,” Angela confessed.</p><p>“I’m learning something every week from their culture, and I really wasn’t embracing that,” she said. “I wasn’t until the therapy.”</p><p>Angela claimed: “‘Cause I’m trying, you know? I’m trying to learn ’cause everyone thinks I got an anger problem. No, I don’t.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“I don’t have an anger problem,” the notorious rage-monster claimed.</p><p>“I just have no tolerance for bulls–t,” she insisted. “And that’s it. I do. I don’t like bulls–t, even from my dog, you know?”</p><p>According to Angela, “When they find out I’m a Mee-maw and my heart’s good, I get run over. That’s why I got to stand up straight in the beginning, like, ‘no hell no, you’re not,’ but if they get into my heart, I’m done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/Angela-Deem-Fight-03.gif><p>“I think this show is gonna knock everybody out the park, because this is the first time couples meet two weeks and live together on an island, not meet at the tell-all,” Angela teased.</p><p>“I get chills thinking about it. I’m very excited,” she expressed. “Even though some outcomes are bad, some are good, and mine, you just don’t know ’till you see it.”</p><p>90 Day: The Last Resort premieres Monday, August 14. A lot of franchise viewers have expressed disgust over this spinoff. But it might do well anyway.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WFcK3NoJylmV2Zsqa5jJyjmqGdqHq0tMRmn5qcXam8brLEp5tmp5aberDAx56pZq%2BforKvv4yhrKyakaOxtHnOp2RyaF2Zrrp506GcZqSRqMFuvsSspqusXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1517-to-paris-heroes-want-clint-eastwood-to-be-their-friend.html><span>←</span><span>15:17 to Paris Heroes Want Clint Eastwood to Be Their Friend</span></a>
