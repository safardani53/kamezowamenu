In a confessional, she explains the memorial took place one year after her father died amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, many of Heather's Mormon family members, including most of her siblings and her mom, chose not to attend the memorial.</p><p>"I had a celebration of life for someone they loved, and they didn't come," she says in her confessional. "I feel like they think it would be a compromise of their values and a betrayal of their faith if they were to endorse me in any way."</p><p>Heather says that her family didn’t have a public funeral for John because of the pandemic, then adds, "It's quite possible that they did something completely private and separate and just did not tell me."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Heather goes on to explain that her relationship with her father changed not long before his death when she went public about questioning her faith.

I still feel compelled to honor his name and his legacy," she shares. "The hard part about that is that he was really, really proud to be a Mormon. He loved being a Mormon, and he loved telling people and sharing it and inviting people in, and sharing the gospel."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though Heather says there's nothing more she wanted in life than to make her dad proud, she knew she'd never be able to be a Mormon and her authentic self.</p><p>Ultimately, the RHOSLC star chose to leave her religion and make decisions for herself.
