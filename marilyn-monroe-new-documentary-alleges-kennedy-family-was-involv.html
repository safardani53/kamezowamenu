Kennedy — the brother of JFK, who was then serving as US attorney general.</p><p>From there, the film presents witnesses who allege that Monroe did not pass away at her LA home, as has been the accepted narrative for the past 60 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“No, she wasn’t [dead at home],” says former Los Angeles ambulance company owner Walter Schaefer, <a href=#>according to</a> the New York Post.</p><p>Schaefer says that when one of his drivers picked Monroe up, she was comatose but still alive.</p><p>He alleges that she passed away en route to the hospital, and was then returned to her home for reasons that remain unclear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That version of events is corroborated by author John Sherlock, who claims that Monroe’s final psychiatrist,&nbsp;Dr. Ralph Greenson, informed him that the actress was alive when paramedics arrived at her home.</p><p>“She died in the ambulance,” Sherlock says in the film.</p><p>“Then they took her back to the house. [Greenson] told me he was in the ambulance.”</p><p>The documentary also features commentary from Anthony Summers, a journalist who has been investigating Monroe’s passing for nearly 40 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“What I learned was information that changed completely what we thought we knew about her mysterious death,” says Summers, who serves as the film’s narrator.</p><p>“And suggests that the circumstances of her dying were covered up.”</p><p>Summers — who is the author of a 1985 book entitled Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe — alleges that both Kennedy brothers ended their affairs with Monroe in 1962 as the events of the Cold War came to present an existential threat to the American way of life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The journalist stops short of claiming that Monroe was murdered, insisting that despite the murkiness surrounding her death, her passing does not seem to be the result of foul play.</p><p>“I did not find out anything that convinced me that she had been deliberately killed,” he says in the film.</p><p>Summers notes, however, that suspicious events — such as Robert Kennedy’s efforts to hide the fact that he was in Los Angeles on the day of Monroe’s death — suggest that some sort of cover-up took place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The tapes I’ve accumulated while writing the book have never been heard by the public,” says Summers.</p><p>“What the evidence suggests is that [the circumstances around her death were] covered up because of her connection with the Kennedy brothers.”</p><p>The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes will be available for streaming on Wednesday, April 27.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WBcLnAq6ClsZ5iurC60aicZqaVrHqlu8KupJ6mpJa%2FunnApaOen5WoeqyxzaecnbFdm66utcuyZLCZo2K2r8LOpa1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-choi.html><span>←</span><span>Michelle Choi</span></a>
