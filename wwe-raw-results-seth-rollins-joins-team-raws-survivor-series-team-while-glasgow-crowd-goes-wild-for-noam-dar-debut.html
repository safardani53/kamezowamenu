They will take on the Smackdown team of Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton, world champ AJ Styles, Baron Corbin and Dean Ambrose.</p><p>All of the warring five Raw grapplers featured <strong>AGAINST</strong> each other in a huge fatal five-way main event – which the champ Owens won after pinning his best friend Chris Jericho after he happened to land on him after being hit with a superman punch from&nbsp;Reigns.</p><p>The lively main event featured Rollins powerbombing Jericho - on top of Strowman - through a table on the outside of the ring in the spot of the night.</p><p>Monday Night Raw began with commissioner Stephanie McMahon introducing the five superstars, including a heavily a booed Reigns, before introducing their final member – after quite the dramatic pause – Rollins.</p><p>Stephanie said that the warring five-some would have to get on the same page, as their “jobs depending on it.”</p><p>Her words did not work.</p><p>Rollins and Reigns began to clash with fierce rivals Jericho and Owens, before Strowman cleared house after attacking all of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-rollins.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-owens.jpg><p>An aggrieved Stephanie then set up the massive, fatal five-way main event for the evening, with “every man for himself”.</p><h3>The Brian Kendrick and Noam Dar vs Rich Swann and Sin Cara</h3><p>A truly incredible ovation greeted the 23-year-old Noam Dar, who was born in Israel&nbsp;but moved to Scotland at the age of five.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-dar.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-dar2.jpg><p>Dar teamed with cruiserweight champ The Brian Kendrick against Rich Swann and Sin Cara, <a href=#>who showed far less fight than he allegedly did backstage last week…</a></p><p>Dar’s team would lose, however. Swann rolling up the champ Kendrick. The irate veteran Kendrick then berated Dar, before attacking him. Dar had his number though, and would eventually flying kick Kendrick out of the ring, much to the delight of his hometown crowd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-dar3.jpg><p>Dar wrestled the match wearing a black armband with the initials ‘KT’ on it in tribute to his friend, the British wrestler Kris Travis who died from cancer earlier this year.<br></p><h3>Token Goldberg vs Lesnar segments</h3><p>Probably because the event was in Scotland, neither Goldberg or Brock Lesnar, who main event Survivor Series on November 20, were in attendance. Instead&nbsp;two videos recapping the last few weeks of their feud were shown with some fresh words from the returning Goldberg in it. “It’s going to be hell,” he says.</p><p>Some pre-recorded words from Lesnar followed in a later segment.</p><p>Lesnar said in it: “I can’t get past why this man, who has a wife and 10 year old son, targets me? It’s foolish.</p><p>“I don’t care what his 10-year old son thinks. I’m not going to show any f****** (bleeped out) mercy on Bill Goldberg.”</p><p>WWE should use Lesnar far more in these UFC-style interviews, which he always executes in brilliant and brutal fashion.</p><p>They will go face-to-face on Raw next week.</p><p>Heating up nicely this one.</p><h3>The New Day vs Gallows and Anderson</h3><p>It’s not just the main Raw Team who are in turmoil. The five tag teams who will join up for a 10-man tag against their Smackdown counterparts are all at odds with each other too.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related stories</h2></p><p>A humorous segment including The New Day entering the ring dressed as Braveharts, mimicked the opening of the show with the narrative of a Raw&nbsp;side&nbsp;in disarray. Enzo and Big Cass, Sheamus and Cesaro, The Golden Truth, and Gallows and Anderson agreed to be in The New Day’s team for Survivor Series, but Gallows and Anderson made it clear they were only in it for themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-new-day.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-new-day2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-tag-team.jpg><p>A match was then set for The New Day against the heels Gallows and Anderson.</p><p>Gallows and Anderson prevailed against the kilt-clad New Day pair of Kofi Kingston and Big E after hitting their Magic Killer on Big E.<br></p><h3>Golden Truth vs Shining Stars</h3><p>Gullible R-Truth traded&nbsp;the Golden Truth’s place in the 10-man Survivor Series event to the Shining Stars for a timeshare in their Puerto Rico condo. Goldust noticed this and got his team a match against the Shining Stars, with the winners getting a spot in the Survivor Series match.</p><p>A rope-assisted roll up on Goldust ended the match, and the Shining Stars will now be in the 10-man tag match against team Smackdown.</p><p>R-Truth must be devastated. He’s lost the timeshare and his team a place in the Survivor Series bout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-tagteam2.jpg><h3>Charlotte, Nia Jax and Dana Brooke vs Bayley, Sasha Banks and Alicia Foxx</h3><p>The crowd sang the Bayley song the whole time in the loudest chant of the night, before Charlotte announced that her protégé, Dana Brooke was the fifth member of the Raw women’s Survivor Series team.</p><p>Quickly after Brooke’s walk-on, however, Michael Cole then announced that the fifth member was actually &nbsp;Charlotte’s Hell In A Cell opponent Sasha Banks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-charlotte.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-womensteam.jpg><p>A six-woman tag match followed, with the face team of Bayley, Sasha Banks and Alicia Fox defeating Charlotte, Nia Jax and Dana Brooke after Bayley pinned the raw women's champ Charlotte after hitting a Bayley to Belly.</p><p>Charlotte had called Bayley the weak link of their Survivor Series team before the match. It does not look that way any more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-womens1.jpg><h3>Rusev vs Sami Zayn (to be intercontinental champ No 1 contender)</h3><p>Raw commissioner Stephanie McMahon wanted Rusev to challenge Smackdown’s Dolph Ziggler for his intercontinental championship at Survivor Series. Raw general manager Mick Foley wanted it to be Sami Zayn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/raw-lana2.jpg><p>So, naturally, they had a match, which Zayn won after hitting his trademark Helluva Kick on the Bulgarian Brute while he was perched on the top rope.</p><p>All eyes to next week then, when Goldberg and Lesnar go face-to-face. Will we see a Jackhammer or an F5? Or both?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yf5ZwZ29np6yybr7AsGSrnaOqubW%2FjKycraBdp7ytuMinqmain567tHnTnpimZaKWxLR50q6pr6GmpL9uv8SroJ6rXamyormMsJ%2BipJVitK2t0qCmsGWTp7y4sIygpp6rXay2rbCMn6arZZ6krq55w5qpZpyVl8K1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacksepticeyes-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is jacksepticeye Dating jacksepticeye's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
