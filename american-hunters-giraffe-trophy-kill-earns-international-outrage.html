"Please share."</p><p>A follow-up tweet is a little less inflammatory.</p><p>"If our so called governments can’t care for our wildlife," the Africa Digest account writes. "Then its time we stand up and responsibility of our continent, lands, resources and wildlife."</p><p>"Share share share! and lets have a united voice against pillage of Africa," the tweet says.

"She lies next to the dead carcass of a *rare* black giraffe in South Africa."</p><p>While we don’t necessarily object to her characterization of Talley, there is some question as to the rarity of this particular species of giraffe.</p><p>"Giraffes are the epitome of gentle giants," Messing says. "They glide across the plains, like liquid; awe inspiring creatures who spend their days eating leaves and caring for their young."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"How DARE she," Messing continues. "A rare animal that will be extinct by the time her grandchildren can go and gutlessly sit in the brush with a scope and pull a trigger."</p><p>In case you missed the grim news, yes, some giraffe species have quietly and quickly slipped from being safe to being critically endangered.</p><p>"It does not take skill to have a ranger track a giraffe for you, and with the aid of night vision glasses and a scope, pull a trigger like some Carnival game," Messing says.</p><p>"If you need to eat a giraffe? Get a bow and arrow and make it at least a fair fight," Messing suggests.</p><p>Most would argue that the but I need to hunt for food argument goes out the window when you book a flight from Kentucky to South Africa.</p><p>"I am disgusted by people like you Tess," Messing says. "You reek of privilege and ignorance. Shame on you. And your husband Andrew Claude. Unconscionable. Irreparable damage. Irreplaceable beauty."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When Tess Thompson Talley first shared the image, she wrote about it.</p><p>"Prayers for my once in a lifetime dream hunt came true today!" Talley announced. "Spotted this rare black giraffe bull and stalked him for quite a while."</p><p>Like the sorts of stories you usually only hear in people’s engagement stories or a serial killer’s diary, she wrote about when she "knew."</p><p>"I knew it was the one," Talley says. "He was over 18 years old, 4000 lbs. and was blessed to be able to get 2000 lbs. of meat from him."</p><p>Since her story went viral, Talley has defended her actions, saying that her hunt aids conservation efforts and that killing this older giraffe was doing a favor for the species.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It is true that giraffes are endangered, with overall populations having plummeted by a staggering 40% in the past 25 years.</p><p>This particular species, however, seems to be doing okay.</p><p>"The giraffe in the photo,"&nbsp;Julian Fennessy of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation says.&nbsp;"Is of the South African species Giraffa giraffe, which are not rare – they are increasing in the wild."</p><p>That’s good news for the South African giraffe.</p><p>However, as many have pointed out, the ethical concerns of big game hunting extend far beyond whether or not a species is in danger.</p><p>There are issues of cruelty. And, when a white person from a global superpower visits Africa, a continent ravaged by vicious colonialism and genocide, there’s possibly a racist angle.</p><p>Killing for conservation is a complicated issue but … wow, the glee in thos photos is a little unsettling.</p><p>These stories are never pleasant.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Rugby Team Poses with Hunting Prey</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcK3Mnqmim5GjeqnBza2cq6tdnLazrcWfnGasoqS9qcWMpKClpF2arrO60magp6yVp7uiwMiopZqkXaTCtb7AoJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-putters-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>15 Best Putters of All Time [2023 Update]</span></a>
