Reeh asked at the start of the clip. "I have a hack for that."</p><p>She held up a piece of art made by one of her children, then headed over to a gallery wall featuring similar drawings.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">These Amazon frames</a> open from the front so all you have to do is push new artwork in," she explained. The frames start at $25 and come in a variety of colors.</p><p>The hinged covers on the picture frames lifted easily, and Reeh was able to slide new artwork in without any hassle.</p><p>Plus, the newest pieces went right on top of the existing artwork thanks to the clever, built-in storage solution.</p><p>"Each frame holds up to 50 pieces," Reeh said, closing up the frame and displaying her updated gallery wall.</p><p>Try using the frames wherever your kids work on their art. "They're great in the mudroom or playroom," she said.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>In the comments, excited parents thanked Reeh for solving an age-old problem.</p><p>"You mean they don’t go on the fridge with a magnet until the papers keep falling every time you open it because the magnet isn’t strong enough?" a parent asked in the comments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000756772156.jpg><p>"That’s brilliant," another person wrote. "If I had those, I could see my fridge again."</p><p>Even non-parents were impressed by the technology.</p><p>"This is GENIUS!" one woman wrote. "I don’t even have kids but I just saved this video to hopefully remember to come back to this video in a few years."</p><p>And of course, Reeh's video received a few pithy comments, too.</p><p>"Amazon also sells shredders," a snarky commenter wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BybW5vZ2d%2FcLzAq5ynrJmjtG63yJ1kmqqkrLyzt4yhmJyjXZa6osbOp2SsrJ%2BnrqixjJ%2BpmqWVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greggs-superfans-new-primark-clothing-range-beloved-bakery.html><span>←</span><span>Greggs superfans snap up new Primark clothing range created with beloved bakery chain - including pa</span></a>
