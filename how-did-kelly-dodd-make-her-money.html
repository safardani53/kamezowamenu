She tells all her friends she likes her parents not being married," Kelly shared. "Now her friends' parents are splitting up, so she's giving advice to the other kids: 'Hey, listen, it's not so bad. It's actually better. It's quiet in the house. There's no tension.'"</p><p>Eventually, Kelly waded back into the dating pool and met Rick Leventhal, a senior correspondent for Fox News.
