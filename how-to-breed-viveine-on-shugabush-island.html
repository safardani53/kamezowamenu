The creature is said to be a “warm and caring soul with the ability to commune with all creatures.” Its in-game model appears as a tree-like creature, with branches for arms and a tuft of grass and flowers for hair. On Shugabush Island, you’ll also find a tiny mouse-like creature running around its base.</p><p>By all accounts, it's a fun design – and collectors will be happy to see it on Shugabush Island.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Viveine's “Likes” include Pipes of Cicado, Shugavox, Echoes of Echo Path, and the Contemporary Plant Sigil Path (Amber Island).</p><p>The song on Shugabush Island is a remix of a song from Kristian Bush – "Love or Money."
