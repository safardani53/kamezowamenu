Well done to Amazon.</p><h2>2. <strong>GuliriFe Women Y2k Short Sleeve Short Jumpsuit</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/61wWEqZIeUS._AC_UX679_.jpg><li><strong>(AD) GuliriFe Women Y2k Short Sleeve Short Jumpsuit, £8.22 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Another bargain Amazon find comes in the form of the GuliriFe Women Y2K Short Sleeve Jumpsuit, priced under £9.</p><p>Available in 10 different colour ways, this t-shirt playsuit is cut from stretch fabric in a tight silhouette.</p><p>Although it's not technically towelling, this playsuit definitely ticks off the trending style in terms of shape and cut.</p><p>Considering that it's under a tenner, we were so happy with this as a holiday-drobe addition – it even comes with a matching halter bikini top.</p><p>The stretchy fabric makes for a smooth, shaping fit and the colour's just as bold as the photos, if not brighter.</p><p>We probably wouldn't wear this beyond the beach though because it's so short, but if that doesn't bother you then we'd definitely snap this up.</p><h2>3. <strong>Mango Towel-Texture Cotton Jumpsuit</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/17091082_50-99999999_01.jpg><ul><li><strong>Towel-Texture Cotton Jumpsuit, £29.99 from Mango - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Mango's take on the towelling trend is one of our favourites on the high-street.</p><p>Their Towel-Texture Cotton Jumpsuit comes in a gorgeous baby blue shade with a belt to complement the oversized fit.</p><p>We expected the material to be slightly thicker and softer which lowered our ratings at first...</p><p>Once we tried it on, we loved it. It's such an easy, throw-on outfit for spring and summer.</p><p>Plus, the roomy fit means you've got enough coverage and it's not too short for us tall women too.</p><p>We're going to team ours with piled-up accessories and big sunnies for our next picnic date.</p><h2>4. Boohoo Towelling Playsuit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fzz17724_washed-lime_xl.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Towelling Playsuit, £20 from Boohoo -<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"> buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Boohoo know how to brighten up your summer wardrobe with a bargain – their Towelling Playsuit comes in this zesty lime shade and we're loving it.</p><p>Don't worry if standing out isn't your thing, there's also options of white and black too for more toned-down looks.</p><p>Complete with a trusty belt, this simple design is perfect for dressing up and down.</p><p>When this arrived, we were so happy with how lightweight and soft the material is, especially considering the affordable price point.</p><p>It's slinky, fluffy and really flatters your body, especially as you can decide how tight you want it with the detachable belt.</p><p>Another plus is that it's not too mini in length either which means you feel totally care-free whenever you wear it. Pimms, anyone?</p><h2>5. Sweaty Betty <strong>Summer Days Romper</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sb6329_navyblue_2.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Summer Days Romper, £80 from Sweaty Betty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>You can tell something's from Sweaty Betty just from looking at the quality fabric – the Summer Days Rommer is towelling good enough to sleep in.</p><p>In a relaxed fit, this navy all-in-one has two pockets and sits at a high-rise waist creating a really flattering silhouette.</p><p>When we tried this on, we instantly understood the £80 price tag. From the softer-than-soft fabric to the slinky oversized fit, we think it'd suit anyone.</p><p>We're always looking for easy-to-style summer clothes that don't make us feel over-exposed and this certainly did the trick.</p><p>The collar is sharp enough to look stylish, especially teamed with a gold chain necklace and sunnies.</p><p>You can definitely rely on this to last you through years of changing trends as you can style it in so many ways. We approve.</p><h2>Where to buy towelling playsuits?</h2><p>Now that terry-towelling is having a moment, so many high-street stores have their own takes on the trend.</p><p>ASOS, Urban Outfitters, Mango, COS and H&M are all among the many retailers jumping on the wave with towelling playsuits.</p><p>Keep your eye out because we don't think the trend is going anywhere.</p><h2>What to look for in a towelling playsuit?</h2><p>Comfort is key. You want a snug number that'll flatter your figure in a way that makes you feel confident.</p><p>Some people like bodycon playsuits whereas others opt for looser styles that come with a belt to cinch your waist.</p><p>When looking for a playsuit, simply find one that makes you feel and look good.</p><h2>Are towelling playsuits in style in 2021?</h2><p>Whether it's due to Hailey Bieber's terry cloth bikinis or how well they look with this season's favourite pastel tones, towelling playsuits are in.</p><p>Bottega Veneta, The Row, Zimmermann and Dries Van Noten are all in on the terry cloth comeback.</p><p>And they've definitely got us wishing for warm weather all year round.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sun Selects</h2></p><p>If you liked our review of the best towelling playsuits then you'll love our roundup of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">best cycling shorts</a>.</p><p>Here are the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">best summer dresses</a> to shop now.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Head to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Sun Selects</a> for more shopping guides, news and deals.</p><p>This article and any featured products have been independently chosen by The Sun journalists.
