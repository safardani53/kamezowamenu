After winning the titular games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) was public enemy No. 1 in President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) eyes. He saw the teen as a threat — not only did she challenge the rules of the Hunger Games, but she later became the face of the rebellion against the Capitol."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

However, at the execution, Katniss shocked the world by aiming the arrow at the interim President of Panem, Alma Coin (<a href=#>Julianne Moore</a>), instead. Wait, why did Katniss kill Coin?! Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lionsgate</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Katniss kill Coin in 'The Hunger Games'?</h2><p>Let's get straight to the point — Katniss killed Coin because she was just as ruthless as Snow.</p><p>After the Mockingjay and<a href=#> Gale (Liam Hemsworth)</a> led a group of rebels to Snow's mansion, a hovercraft arrived and dropped bombs into the crowd of children. When a group of medics, including Katniss' younger sister, Prim (<a href=#>Willow Shields</a>), came to help, they were all killed by a second bombing, which Gale knew about.</p><p>Katniss then visited an imprisoned Snow, who said he didn't order the brutal attack; Coin did. He explained that Coin orchestrated the bombings and sent them in a hovercraft decorated with the Capitol seal to turn Snow's supporters against him. Katniss didn't believe him, but Snow reminded her of their promise to never lie to each other.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Toward the end of the film, Coin summoned the surviving Hunger Games victors to discuss the future of Panem. She declared herself as the interim President of Panem and suggested that to end the violence of the rebellion, they hold a symbolic Hunger Games using the children of Capitol leaders as revenge.</p><p>Although some of the tributes are against it, others — including Katniss — support the idea. She claimed she wanted to avenge Prim, but her vote also allowed her to gain Coin's trust.</p><p>At the public execution, Katniss approached Snow with her bow in hand. Overlooking them was President Coin, who delivered a speech to the crowd before the small-town girl from District 12 raised her bow. She aimed it at Snow, but in the end, she shot Coin with her arrow. Coin fell from her podium and Snow began to laugh, which caused a riot of citizens to band together and kill the sadistic old man.</p><p>Katniss did the right thing because, as previously stated, Coin was just as cruel as Snow. She was willing to sacrifice children to turn the Capitol citizens against Snow and make herself out to be the hero who saved the nation. Rather than allowing Coin to begin her reign of terror, Katniss put a stop to it, and as a result, she saved future generations from ever having to experience the Hunger Games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ajkam7qr%2FSZqKipJxisLC1zWafrqaXmr9us8CmnKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-del-castillo-claims-parts-sean-penn-rolling-stone-el-chapo-interview-not-true.html><span>←</span><span>Kate del Castillo Slams Sean Penn's El Chapo Rolling Stone Interview</span></a>
