She has a gorgeous, unique voice that sets her apart from the rest of the competition. From her history on The Voice season 22 to her original music, here’s what you need to know about Sasha.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sasha-Hurtado-5-things-the-voice-embed1.jpg><h2>1. Sasha was stolen by Gwen Stefani.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Sasha performed the <strong>Bishop Briggs</strong> hit “River” for her Blind Audition. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Camila Cabello</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Legend</strong></a> turned their red chairs for Sasha. Sasha chose Camila as her coach. The singer went head-to-head with <strong>Devix</strong> in the Battles, and Camila ended up keeping Devix on her team. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a> quickly used her only steal in the Battles to nab Sasha. Gwen said that Sasha’s performance was “too good,” and Sasha just needed a little “love” to push her in the “right direction.”</p><h2>2. Sasha gets praise from John Legend and Blake Shelton during the Knockouts.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>After the 3-way Knockout between Sasha, Alyssa, and Dayshia, John and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a> both told Gwen that she should pick Sasha as the winner. “Sasha, every note you hit was flawless,” John said. “I loved your vibrato. Vocally it was just a tour de force. Though, decision-wise for Gwen, I think it’s tough. But I think as a vocalist, I think Sasha was my favorite.” Blake added that he would “be going with Sasha right now.”</p><h2>3. Sasha is from Georgia.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sasha was born and raised in Dallas, Georgia. She comes from a multicultural military family. Her father is Mexican and her mother is from Florida, according to Sasha’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBC bio</a>. Sasha’s mom was the daughter of a Navy vet.</p><h2>4. Sasha’s released original music.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sasha has already dropped <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two singles</a>. Her original songs are titled “First” and “Mr. No Good Guy.” On her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official website</a>, Sasha wrote that she “draws inspiration from a range of soulful, pop-filled, and indie artists that have helped carve out her own unique lane of artistic expression.”\</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sasha-Hurtado-5-things-the-voice-embed2.jpg><h2>5.
