Celebrating my love's birthday on this stunning Italian island was an absolute dream. We soaked up the sun, visited the pristine beaches, and experienced the true essence of an Italian summer, surrounded by a group of amazing friends."</p><p>Shayna continued: "From the moment we arrived, I was struck by the beauty of Sardinia's clear blue waters and soft sandy beaches. We spent mornings sunbathing on the boat, making makeshift matchas, and taking refreshing dips in the sea. The warmth of the sun was only matched by the warmth of the friendships we formed here. I feel so incredibly welcome in Italy, creating new friends and new experiences that have left a lasting impression on me."</p><p>"In the evenings, we wandered through the charming streets of Alghero, enjoying the local cuisine and soaking in the vibrant atmosphere. The laughter and conversations we shared over amazing meals made every moment even more special. We indulged in delicious seafood and took in the sights and sounds of the city's bustling old town… it was the best type of mini vacation!"</p><p>She concluded: "But beyond the sights and activities, it was the simple moments that made this weekend extraordinary. Holding hands during sunset walks, immersing ourselves in the beauty of an Italian summer, and feeling the joy of being surrounded by such wonderful and truly welcoming people. This weekend was definitely one to remember, and I can't wait for more and more adventures to come in Italy."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>TURN THE PAIGE</h2><p>Meanwhile, Ryan's current girlfriend Aubrey Paige has shared about starting the best chapter of her life in a recent post.</p><p>Fans are begging the couple to get engaged after her tease.</p><p>On Tuesday, Aubrey shared a quote to her&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;Story.</p><p>The quote read: "You're about to walk into one of the best chapters of your life.
