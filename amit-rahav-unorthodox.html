While Shira Haas is undoubtedly the breakout star of Netflix's latest limited series, Unorthodox, we can't ignore Amit Rahav, who plays Yanky, her character Esther Shapiro's husband.

"Yiddish is my native language."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unorthodox tells a powerful and amazing story about standing out, fitting in, and finding your voice in the face of adversity. And while the community it centers of might not be familiar to everyone (you will find that there is plenty to learn from the Satmar way of doing weddings, for example), the story is a decidedly universal one.</p><p>In short, the four-episode limited series makes for an exciting binge—one that has so far garnered a 92% approval rating from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p><p>Stream Unorthodox today on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrqqwIyrmKGZpmLCr7vRrZ%2BonJ%2Bt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joan-jett-cherie-currie-weigh-in-on-jackie-foxs-rape-allegations-2015137.html><span>←</span><span>Joan Jett, Cherie Currie Weigh in on Jackie Fox's Rape Allegations</span></a>
