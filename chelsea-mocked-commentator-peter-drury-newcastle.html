The Blues were beaten 1-0 at St James' Park on Saturday evening.
Joe Willock grabbed the winner with his sweet strike midway through the second half. Chelsea managed just five shots in the 90 minutes including just two on target.
The result was Graham Potter's side's third Premier League defeat in a row and means they go into the World Cup break winless in their last five - and knocked out of the Carabao Cup."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
