That is our foremost consideration, and we believe that he will strengthen the Raith Rovers playing squad.</p><p>“Please be assured that as a community football club we fully acknowledge this signing has divided opinion amongst our loyal fans and commercial stakeholders; we aim to rebuild that trust.</p><p>“While acknowledging the gravity of what happened ten years ago, as a club we fully support and encourage rehabilitation, and many factors influenced our signing. But first and foremost, this was a football related decision.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4N0g49tbGickau2pXnGqKadr5mhuaqxjLCfqGWilra1tIyrpq%2Bdoqh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenya-moore-cleavage.html><span>←</span><span>Kenya Moore, Cleavage - The Hollywood Gossip</span></a>
