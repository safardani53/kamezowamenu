This [new] look is more subtle.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hazan explained that she wanted to give Beyoncé a post-Renaissance refresh that is “toned-down” and “perfect for fall” as the hitmaker pursues other projects that don’t require her to be on stage.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When it comes to working her magic on Queen Bey, Hazan told Us that the Grammy winner gives her “creative freedom.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“She lets me do whatever I want, and for me, that’s the most fun part. With her, I like to switch it up every time I do her hair. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Sometimes I add more blonde — or it’s about the placement and it depends on what she’s got going on,” Hazan shared.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Beyonce-New-Hair-Color-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>She continued, “This time around, I lightened up a little bit less and added more depth and didn’t put as many highlights as I did for Renaissance. I call it a ‘Chantilly’ color because it was more of a creamy [blonde] with golden tones to it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for the process, Hazan used her namesake haircare line’s <a href=#>Ultimate True Color Shine Gloss</a> in Sun-Kissed mixed with her brand’s <a href=#>Breaking Brass Gloss</a> to “give her that neutral but still yellow glow that works very nice with her skin tone.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After finalizing the hue, Hazan went in with her <a href=#>Weekly Remedy Treatment</a> and left her hair in conditioner to “nurture” her roots.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hazan went on to stress the most important aspect of the process: safe maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’ve been working with Beyoncé for almost 10 years, and treatment is crucial, especially when you are blonde and use heat tools. You have to be really careful, and it’s my job to make sure that I don’t push it over the edge. I pay attention to the quality of her hair, and after the tour, she needed a little bit of a break. So, adding some contrast with [warmer] color allows her hair to heal and relax,” Hazan told Us.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For those wanting to go Beyoncé blonde, Hazan warns to “take it slow” and “be patient.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“My biggest tip is to do your research. Find out who is capable of doing what you want. Make sure they know how to work with your hair texture and keep it healthy. If you damage your hair by going blonde too fast — you can’t recover from that,” Hazan said.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Beyonce-New-Hair-Color-3.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Do it in phases. In the beginning, with Beyoncé, it took us like three or four times to get it perfect.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hazan also gushed about Beyoncé’s own upcoming haircare line.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“We speak about it all the time. She’s asked me a lot of questions, so I’m sure it’s going to be phenomenal,” Hazan told Us. “She’s got the knowledge already from her mom [Tina Knowles], who was previously a hairstylist.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Beyonce <a href=#>teased the new venture</a> in May, posting a photo that showed her sitting at a beauty vanity, holding a curling wand in her hand. Elsewhere in the snap, an array of unlabeled products could be seen on a counter. The jars, which appeared to be spray bottles, were filled with a golden liquid.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“How many of y’all knew my first job was sweeping hair in my mama’s salon?” Beyoncé began. “Destiny’s Child got our start by performing for clients while they were getting their hair done. I was exposed to so many different kinds of entrepreneurial women in her salon.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She added: “I saw firsthand how the ways we nurture and celebrate hair can directly impact our souls. I watched her heal and be of service to so many women. Having learned so much on my hair journey, I’ve always dreamed of carrying on her legacy. I can’t wait for you to experience what I’ve been creating.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a5rXnAm6aurF2Xsrq7zZycrGWTp7Kiudhmp6irpGK%2FprrAoqqsmZ6Ysm60wKKpZpufobyzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kimberly-ann-ryan-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kimberly Ann Ryan Dating Now</span></a>
