One video clip showed Keleigh jumping into the water below, while another showed the foursome happily hiking down to the water.</p><p>“Ponds with soulmates 🦋🌈🌈,” she wrote.</p><p>Later, the model <a href=#>shared</a> a selfie that appeared to be taken by the Whiplash actor, 34. In the photo, the couples posed side by side with a sunset behind them.</p><p>“Happiness🦋🦋🌈💗,” Keleigh’s caption read.</p><p>Miles and Woodley, 29, are extremely close friends, having acted together in multiple films including 2012’s The Spectacular Now and later in <a href=#>the Divergent franchise</a>.</p><p>“I look at Miles and, like, I’m sort of&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong>&nbsp;</a>in the same way she is to [<a href=#><strong>George Clooney</strong></a>],” the Big Little Lies actress told Vanity Fair in June 2014. “Their relationship I could see <a href=#>being our relationship in 20 years</a>, and&nbsp;that really is special.”</p><p>While Miles <a href=#>has been married to Keleigh since 2019</a>, his double dates with Woodley and Rodgers, 37, are a somewhat new friendship development.</p><p>In February, Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed the pair were secretly dating</a>. Soon after, Rodgers <a href=#>announced their engagement</a> when he slyly shouted out his “fiancée” during the NFL honors dinner in February.</p><p>During an appearance on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon later that month, the Fault in Our Stars actress revealed she was finding out <a href=#>more about her future husband every day</a>.</p><p>“We met during this whacky, whacky time and all the stadiums were closed that he was playing in. I didn’t really grow up with sports, especially American sports. It was never really on my radar,” she said at the time. “When we met, also, I knew he was a football guy, but I didn’t know like what kind of a football guy he was. And I’m still constantly learning.”</p><p>Besides the beautiful views, the couples <a href=#>had more fun on their vacation</a> including impromptu dance parties and <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> sing-alongs.</p><p>In a <a href=#>video</a> posted by Keleigh, the California native and football player jammed to “The 1” by Taylor Swift as Woodley giggled in the background. In a separate <a href=#>clip</a> that floated around social media, the couples danced to a cover of “Stand By Me” while out at a restaurant.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later, they all sang along to “Wagon Wheel” while Rodgers strummed a guitar.</p><p>Scroll to see inside the pairs’ magical Maui getaway:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrqK%2Bzqdkq6eUnLKzv4ysn5qhnJq7pnnWqKadpJWuwG65wK6gZp%2BVqa64rdhmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-osvaldo-rios-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Osvaldo Rios Dating Now</span></a>
