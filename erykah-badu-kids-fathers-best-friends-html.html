She has three kids with three different rappers — André 3000, D.O.C, and Jay Electronica. Here is what we know about her children and their fathers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Badu and André 3000&nbsp;</h2><p>Badu met the rapper at a club in New York back in 1995. Weeks after the release of her first album, Baduizm, their first child was conceived. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with The New Yorker magazine, André 3000 revealed that the pair had to decide if they wanted to keep the child or not because of their hectic schedule.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Regardless, they kept the baby, and Seven Sirius Benjamin was born on November 18, 1997, the same day Badu’s live album, Live, was released. Even though the pair separated soon after their son’s birth, they still have a close relationship with one another. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Badu And D.O.C</h2><p>Shortly after the birth of Seven, Badu started dating Dallas-based rapper D.O.C. The rapper had been in a gruesome accident that took his voice away, reducing it to a raspy whisper. He was in a critical position with his life and career, but meeting Badu helped him get away from his dark bubble.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Badu gave birth to their daughter Puma Sabti Curry on July 5, 2004. The duo was together for a few more years before parting ways. Despite them not being involved romantically, they remained in touch. D.O.C. even considers the singer to be one of the closed people in his life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Badu And Jay Electronica</h2><p>The singer’s third child was also with another prominent rapper — Jay Electronica. On February 1, 2009, Badu gave birth to Mars Merkaba Thedford, her second daughter. Like her brother and sister, Thedford was also born at home.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Rappers Are Friends With Each Other&nbsp;</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with DJ Vlad, D.O.C opened up about his relationship with André 3000 and Jay Electronica. He revealed he loves and respects his fellow rappers. He confirmed he is on excellent terms with them and said that he is a great fan of both of them.</p><p>D.O.C said they all love each other and want the best for one another. Implying how good his relationship is with his fellow rappers, he said that if he called and asked them to come to him, they wouldn’t hesitate.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Badu Doesn’t Consider Herself A Single Parent</h2><p>Not only the rappers, but Badu herself is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best friends</a> with all three of her previous lovers, and they co-parent perfectly. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She told The&nbsp;New Yorker that all the fathers are always there with her. Since the rappers mostly live in Dallas, they have formed a tight community amongst themselves.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The hub for the rappers is Badu’s lakefront house, where the fathers hang out with their children.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmHymvtikmKFlkpaxtnnKopusZZaWwamx0axkm52jqXqnvsiepZ2rXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./woman-falls-death-down-well-shaft-hidden-under-rotting-floorboards-8407255.html><span>←</span><span>Woman, 83, Falls to Death Down Well Shaft Hidden Under Floorboards</span></a>
