By parking your car with the wheels turned into the kerb, thieves will have to make more manoeuvres to drive off. Parking in a row of cars or facing a wall will also deter criminals.”</li><li data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Failing to hide key fob: </strong>“Many car owners believe that locking their keys in a drawer or placing them out of sight in a secure home is enough to protect their vehicles but criminals can use devices that relay the signal from keys and unlock devices remotely. Keep your keys at least 20m away from any doors, criminals can’t pick up a signal. You can also use an RFID Wallets which provide a casing for your keys.”</li><li data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Leaving a mess in your motor: </strong>“One of the biggest mistakes that car owners make is leaving rubbish and mess lying around. When a criminal walks past they will see this as an opportunity to find something valuable. Keeping valuables out of sight and tidying away any rubbish is an effective way to deter criminals.</li><li data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Not using a dash cam with surveillance mode: </strong>“All dash cams are designed to record your drive, but some dashboard cameras can also monitor your car when you are not there. It is a very useful feature to guard against any would-be thieves or if you are worried about any potential vandalism on your car.”</li><li data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Michael also noted leaving ownership documents in the car and failing to check the door is actually locked are other common mistakes drivers make.</li></ul><p>However despite featuring high on the list, it's likely Ford's compact models were among the most common theft targets due to their high popularity and sheer number on the road.</p><p>Thieves also targeted the Vauxhall Astra and Volkswagen Golf, with 344 and 340 models stolen, respectively.</p><p>The Vauxhall Corsa was another popular choice with criminals, according to the figures, as 306 vehicles were stolen last year.</p><p>As the figures only cover just over a third of the police forces in the UK, they don't represent the nature of car theft for the entire country.</p><p>Last year we revealed the<a href=#> models most likely to be stolen from streets all over Britain,</a> with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class most at-risk.</p><p>The study by GoCompare also revealed some of the UK streets where your motor is more likely to be stolen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Streets.png><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more news on car theft</h2></p><p>High Street in Staffordshire was the worst place to leave your motor, with local police reporting 55 motor thefts in 2018.</p><p>Another hotspot for vehicle crime was Cornwall Road in Leicestershire, where thieves stole 22 vehicles.</p><p>And Humberside Police reported 18 motor thefts in Anlaby Road.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Common mistakes you could be making that put your car at risk of theft</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHx6fZFwaXBrX6m1pnnMqKqtZZansrLBxKerpbFdqMGwuMSnZJyZomK6sLDEpapmmZ6ZerS7zJ5kqJ5dqbWmedSkqmaqmai4qrHSrWSsrKKasrW%2FjJ%2Bmq2WmmrWqr8ueZK2glZvBcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ricardo-fort-19681105-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ricardo Fort (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
