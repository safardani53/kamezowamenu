which may have saved her life by absorbing some of the impact.</p><p>The girl ran to another customer to show her injuries with the arrow sticking out of her chest.</p><p>Bourke is then seen approaching from behind along one of the aisles and shooting again - but he misses.</p><p>She flees once more and is shielded by a Good Samaritan as Bourke fires his last arrow - and misses.</p><p>Astonishingly, Bourke then calmly walked up to the wounded girl holding a sledgehammer and asked for his arrow back, the prosecutor said.</p><p>The ordeal only ended when two other shoppers tackled the assailant to the ground in September 2020.</p><h2>Murderous intent</h2><p>Mr Le Grand said Bourke, then 25, had been intent on ending his own life after a row with his flatmate.</p><p>His solution was to spark "public panic" and "provoke the police into a violent standoff".</p><p>The prosecutor said: “He decided to take a life, he just didn’t know which life he would take.”</p><p>Dressed all in black, he set out on foot wearing a face mask and armed with the compound bow, three hammers and two knives.</p><p>He was seen on CCTV firing an arrow at a passing jogger - but he missed her.</p><p>Next he considered killing a mother who was with her baby, but decided against it.</p><p>Mr Le Grand said Bourke continued to the shopping precinct as “there would be more witnesses at the shops”.</p><p>“Causing an alarm was part of Mr Bourke’s plan,” he said.</p><p>He added Bourke showed no remorse and that the girl became the victim of his murderous intent because she "happened to be in his path".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>A psychiatric report said Bourke had "a primitive and immature personality", was angry at the world and felt justified in his anti-social behaviour.</p><p>Bourke, who admitted attempted murder, was sentenced to ten and a half years in jail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/maniac-hunts-teenage-girl-aldi-812768997.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/maniac-hunts-teenage-girl-aldi-812769157.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">YOU'RE NOT ALONE</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.</p><p>It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society -
