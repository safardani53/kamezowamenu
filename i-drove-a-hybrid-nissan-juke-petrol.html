Rubbish. They want one that makes them look good. But these aren’t usual times. The price of petrol, like just about everything else, is going through the roof.
Suddenly people really do want a car that drinks less.
So it’s a good time for Nissan to launch a hybrid version of the Juke."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But it’s more complicated than the usual petrol one, of course, so it costs more.</p><p>Is it worth spending extra buying the car to spend less on fuelling it? We did a real-world test. We drove the Hybrid on a mixed route of city, dual carriageways, rural roads and villages. It did 43.2mpg.</p><p>Not as good as the official number...but I wasn’t hanging about. Straight after, I took a normal petrol Juke and drove the same route in the same way in similar traffic. It got 36.9mpg.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun ">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>So, let’s crunch the numbers. Say you do 600 miles a month, which is 7,200 a year. The Hybrid at 43.2mpg would use 13.9 gallons for 600 miles. That’s 63.1 litres, which at £1.85 a litre (gulp) is £117 a month.</p><p>Do the same sums for the 36.9mpg non-hybrid and you get £127 a month. Here’s where it gets interesting.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>Both these <a href=#>Jukes</a> come on a three-year finance deal with a £1,500 deposit. In the popular N-Connecta trim, the <a href=#>Hybrid</a> is £404 a month. The pure-petrol auto is £392 a month.</p><p>So the Hybrid is £12 a month dearer to buy but £20 a month cheaper for <a href=#>fuel</a>. Saving you £8. A small advantage, but an advantage nevertheless. And there’s more to it that that.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">PETROL</h3></p><p><strong>CHEAPER TO BUY</strong></p><p><strong>NISSAN JUKE DIG-T AUTO</strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> £25,520<br><strong>Engine:</strong> 1-litre petrol<br><strong>Power: </strong>114hp 0-62mph: 11.8 secs<br><strong>Top speed:</strong> 112mph<br><strong>Economy: </strong>47mpg<br><strong>Emissions:</strong> 137g/km<br><strong>Finance:</strong> £392 per month with £1,500 deposit<br><strong>Monthly fuel bill: </strong>£137</p><p>The Hybrid is much quieter. Much of the time, especially in town, it operates on electric power alone.</p><p>When you slow down, or descend hills, or the engine starts but not all its power is needed for the wheels, the battery gets charged. You don’t need to plug in.</p><p>The hybrid is also usefully more powerful. It does 0-62mph nearly two seconds quicker than the plain petrol. The Juke is a perky little character. For a small crossover, the steering is sharp and the cornering terrier-like.</p><p>That firm suspension does mean it’s a bit bumpy at town speed, mind. The Juke remains a car a lot of people love the look of. Not just the outside but inside too.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>In most small crossovers, you find a borrowed supermini dash and seats. But the Juke has extra sass and plushness. It is designed, engineered and made in Britain – and over two generations, it has sold more than a third of a million in this country.</p><p>The Hybrid has the same style but better consumption and performance. Hard to see how it’ll lose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000742084992.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">HYBRID</h3></p><p><strong>CHEAPER TO RUN</strong></p><p><strong>NISSAN JUKE HYBRID</strong></p><p><strong>Price: </strong>£27,250<br><strong>Engine: </strong>1.6l petrol hybrid<br><strong>Power: </strong>143hp 0-62mph: 10.1 secs<br><strong>Top speed: </strong>109mph<br><strong>Economy: </strong>56mpg<br><strong>Emissions: </strong>114g/km<br><strong>Finance: </strong>£404 per month with £1,500 deposit<br><strong>Monthly fuel bill: </strong>£117</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxyhY9ta2ppYGS2brDRqK2eZZFitbqu0aKbZqaZqMCiuoyjrKSdXaWytb7OpWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hubert-aiwanger-weight-loss-before-and-after-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Hubert Aiwanger Weight Loss: Before And After Photo</span></a>
