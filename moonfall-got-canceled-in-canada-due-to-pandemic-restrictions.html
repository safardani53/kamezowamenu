His most recent masterwork, which was filmed in Montreal in 2020, is going to be released theatrically.</p><h2>Due to pandemic limitations, Moonfall has been canceled in Canada.</h2><p>The sci-fi will finally visit cinemas throughout the United States on February 4 after multiple delays due to the epidemic. However, the film will not be distributed in Canadian cinemas. The film‚Äôs theatrical premiere in Canada has been canceled, according to distributor Mongrel Media, owing to the uncertainty surrounding theater closures.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Driving ‚úÖ<br>Driving while the moon is falling to earth ü•¥ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2JzfhxQVrN</a></p><p>‚Äî Moonfall (@MoonfallFilm) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 2, 2022</a></p><p>Due to the omicron epidemic, some Canadian movie theaters have been shuttered. COVID-19 restrictions were increased, and lockdowns were implemented in hotspots such as Toronto and Montreal. Things are looking better now, and a staggering reopening is in effect. Despite this, the distributors have decided not to take the risk of distributing the film in Canadian cinemas. Daniel S√©guin, Cineplex‚Äôs senior vice-president of national operations, replied to this move by saying:</p><p>‚ÄúWe are saddened to discover that the picture Moonfall‚Äôs distributor has no plans for a theatrical distribution in Canada.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moonfall-2.jpg><h2>What is the story of Moonfall?</h2><p>The sci-fi film is directed by Emmerich, who also co-wrote the screenplay with <strong>Harold Kloser</strong> and <strong>Spenser Cohen</strong>. It depicts the moon being thrown out of orbit and on a crash path with Earth.&nbsp;To rescue the Earth from disaster, astronauts Jocinda ‚ÄúJo‚Äù Fowler and Brian Harper collaborated with conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman to explore why the moon switched course. However, this inquiry discloses some previously unknown deep dark mysteries concerning the moon.&nbsp;Patrick Wilson, John Bradley, Halle Berry, Michael Pea, Charlie Plummer, Kelly Yu, and Donald Sutherland are among the film‚Äôs notable cast members.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikqKeem66tuIygpq1lk5a7pLHLnptmoZ5isKK6wJ2YZpylmnq1u4ypmKeclaK2pHnRnqqtqpmYwaq7zaxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yung-gravy-foot-locker-holiday-songs-interview.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Yung Gravy Gets Into The Holiday Vibes With His Foot Locker Collab Hollywood Life</span></a>
