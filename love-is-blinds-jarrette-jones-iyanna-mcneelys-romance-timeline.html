You were made for me and I was made for you.”</p><p class=p1>The Chicago residents <a href=#>initially connected in the pods</a>, quickly<a href=#> forging a strong bond after sharing their vulnerabilities</a>. However, Jarrette also had strong feelings for fellow contestant<strong> Mallory Zapata</strong>.</p><p class=p1>“Earlier this week, I was <a href=#>going back and forth between Mallory and Iyanna</a> but other the past couple days, I’ve gained clarity,” the health care consultant opened up in a confessional interview via the third episode. “I can definitely see myself proposing and having a life with Iyanna, but I <a href=#>want to propose to Mallory</a> and it’s gonna feel crazy, you know. I’m gonna feel a whirlwind of emotions.”</p><p class=p1>Mallory eventually turned Jarrette down, later <a href=#>accepting a proposal from <strong>Salvador “Sal” Perez</strong></a>. (The pair broke off their engagement during the finale.) Following his rejection from Mallory, Jarrette went back to Iyanna, citing her consistent love and support before <a href=#>he popped the question</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Some things are better left unsaid…But seeing her for the first time truly left me speechless…,” Jarette gushed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in February 2022, sharing <a href=#>footage from their first in-person meeting</a>.</p><p class=p1>Since their final decision, the <a href=#>twosome have continued to work on their marriage</a> and exclusively opened up about where things stand with&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>.</p><p class=p1>“My logic was telling me, ‘I don’t know this man and I don’t know if I can trust him when he says that he’s gonna make me the priority,’” the program coordinator recalled to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>of her relationship. “But right after Mexico, it was no longer an issue for us. We <a href=#>were kind of just focused on us</a>.”</p><p class=p1>Iyanna continued at the time: “And then, thankfully, with the ex-girlfriend thing, we were able to come to a conclusion and he heard me out. He heard my concerns and he ultimately showed me that I was a priority. So by the time we got to wedding day, I was really just in the feels. I was just really excited and really just ready to get it done.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Things changed, however, in August 2022, when the pair announced they had “separated and will begin the progress of divorcing.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to check out the pair’s complete relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkubDCxGagrGWSobavsNJmoZqqoprBtbGMo6annaNitrqtzaeYZqWTo7KmuNisZKunnZa7pLGMraCmnZyeu6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jill-amy-duggar-tears-tell-all-familys-secrets.html><span>←</span><span>Jill and Amy Duggar break down in tears as they tell all on family's secrets in Amazon Prime doc's e</span></a>
