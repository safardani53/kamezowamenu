Another Twitter user joked, “Ben Affleck is every guy at his wife’s work party.”</p><p>A third fan tweeted, “Ben Affleck is all of us when we realize it’s a school night and we’re out past our bedtime.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Jenny From the Block” singer</a> — who presented the trophy for Best Pop Vocal Album to <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a> — later <a href=#>gushed about her husband</a> despite his laughable awards show faces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/How-Ben-Affleck-and-Jennifer-Lopez-Really-Reacted-to-His-Grammys-Memes-3.jpg><p>“Always the best time with my love, my husband,” Lopez <a href=#>captioned a video montage</a> on February 6 of the pair’s best moments at the Grammys.</p><p>Three days later, the Hustlers star <a href=#>seemingly got in on the joke</a> when she trolled her spouse while promoting his new movie <a href=#>Air</a>.</p><p>“My husband’s happy face,” Lopez <a href=#>added as text on a still of Affleck’s frowning expression</a> while in character via Instagram on February 9. The Shotgun Wedding actress then pushed the upcoming movie, which her partner stars in and directs alongside BFF <a href=#><strong>Matt Damon</strong></a>.</p><p>The “Waiting for Tonight” songstress captioned the clip: “AIR … cannot wait! @AIRmovie Starring #MattDamon, @ViolaDavis, #JasonBateman, @ChrisTucker, #ChrisMessina & Directed by #BenAffleck.”</p><p>Days later, the couple, <a href=#>who tied the knot in summer 2022</a> after reconnecting one year prior, costarred in <a href=#>a Super Bowl LVII commercial for Dunkin’</a> — which happens to be Affleck’s coffee shop of choice.</p><p>The ad aired during <a href=#>the Philadelphia Eagles vs. Kansas City Chiefs game</a> on Sunday, February 12. It showed the Oscar winner working at a real Dunkin’ drive-thru and going somewhat undetected in Massachusetts.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At one point, Lopez drives up and scolds her husband for allegedly keeping his side hustle a secret. “What are you doing here? Is this what you do when you say you’re going to work all day?” she asked. Us later confirmed that Affleck directed the commercial, which was shot in his home state in January.</p><p>Watch the exclusive video above to learn more about Affleck and Lopez’s Grammys night out — and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6dir6a6jJqdn6SVmLhutsSnpaKelad6rbvPnrFmqpWWsLWxw2arqGWXp66uudisZKadnZrAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-vine.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What Led to the End of Vine!</span></a>
