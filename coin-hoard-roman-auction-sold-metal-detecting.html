Experts say they discovered the &#34;secret&#34; to finding these types of rarities again.
An anonymous metal detectorist found a treasure of coins worth $19,000 while searching through a field in Norfolk, England in 2020.
The hobbyist found a total of 430 coins from the Roman era, dating as far back as 5BC.
73 of the most valuable ones were auctioned in London earlier this month, selling for £15,000 (around $19,000)."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
