If they go well, they can make life much calmer and easier as a new parent. That goes for both bottle and formula feeding, too.”</p><p>If you do choose to <a href=#>breastfeed</a>, make sure you buy yourself some comfortable nursing bras. The NHS recommends getting measured for this when you’re around 36 to 38 weeks <a href=#>pregnant</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also need to pick up some nursing pads, or breast pads.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON PARENTING">READ MORE ON PARENTING</h2><p>Go for a multi-pack; it’s recommended you change them every three to four hours, as the nutrients in breast milk coupled with your body heat can make them a breeding ground for bacteria.</p><p>Mums we spoke to also swore by nipple cream - which is also great for chapped lips!</p><p>If you’re keen to share the load, our Sun mums recommended investing in a hands-free breast pump, as your partner can then bottle feed your little one, giving you a break while they’re still getting all the benefits of your breast milk.</p><p>Heidi says: “The Pippeta wearable hands free breast pump gets a big thumbs up from me.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/0031ecb8-0ad8-42a2-865a-ef6df8d0fd04.jpg><p>“It saved my breastfeeding journey - with three children to look after, it meant I could pump and leave baby with a bottle whilst still providing her with the breastmilk she needed.”</p><p>The <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Medela solo hands free in-bra pump</a> also came highly recommended by our Sun mums.</p><p>Heidi adds: “Whilst you don’t need fancy gadgets if you’re breastfeeding, don’t forget that investing in a lactation consultant to help you get your latch right, and make breastfeeding easier, is also a super worthwhile investment.”</p><p>If you opt to formula feed, our Sun mums said investing in a formula maker proved a Godsend for those late night feeds.</p><p>The <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Baby Brezza Formula Maker</a> is a great all-rounder; it makes a warm formula bottle almost instantly, features easy-to-use digital controls and works with virtually all formula and bottle brands and sizes.</p><p>Another gadget that will help make life that little bit easier (which you could add to your <a href=#>Christmas</a> list) is a steriliser which washes and dries bottles. While it’ll take up some space on your counter, just think of the clutter you’ll save around the sink!</p><p>Our Sun mums recommend the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Vital Baby UV Steriliser</a> - it destroys 99.9% of bacteria, and sterilises and dries in less than half an hour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/lifestyle-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TrippTrapp_BabySet_News23_230215_8307.jpg><p>As it uses UV instead of water, heat or chemicals, you can pretty much sterilise anything in there - bottles, soothers, toys, cosmetic brushes, even your mobile phone!</p><p>You might not consider a high chair until your little one moves onto solid food, but should you wish your new arrival to join you at the table, some come with special newborn adapters.</p><p>Baby and parenting expert Rachel Fitz, author of Your Baby Skin to Skin, says: “A high chair with a newborn kit, such as the <a href=# aria-label="Tripp Trapp from Stokke, (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Tripp Trapp from Stokke,</a> would be perfect as it grows with your child.</p><p>“You can use it from newborn, to baby (with the baby set) to toddler and beyond, as adults can sit in them too, making it a long term investment.”</p><p>For playtime at home and chilling in front of the telly, our Sun mums recommend the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Baby Bjorn Bouncer Bliss</a> - a&nbsp;lightweight and handy baby bouncer which comes in loads of colours and provides a natural rocking motion to soothe your little one.</p><p>Another excellent investment is a <a href=# aria-label="Totter&nbsp;+ Tumble (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Totter&nbsp;+ Tumble</a> playmat - they come in a wide range of stylish reversible designs that won't make your home feel like a nursery, are made from thick memory foam and roll out and wipe down super easily.</p><p>If friends and family are asking what to buy you ahead of your little one’s arrival, our mums suggested a <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Kit & Kin nappy subscription</a> or a <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Kendamil baby milk formula subscription</a>. It’s something a bit different, and most mums will appreciate it!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unnamed-7.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sleeping</strong></h2><p>For the first six months it's recommended that your baby sleeps in the same room as you.</p><p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Lullaby Trust guidelines</a> state the safest place for a baby to sleep is in their own clear separate space, such as a cot or Moses basket.</p><p>Heidi says: “Next-to-bed cots are an ideal scenario for those looking to sleep close to baby.</p><p>“They enable you to easily reach in to baby when they wake for feeds and they keep baby nice and cosy in their small sleeping space, too.”</p><p>The <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SnüzPod bedside crib</a> is a great option and is popular with celebrities including <a href=#>Lucy Mecklenburgh</a>, <a href=#>Vogue Williams</a>, <a href=#>Helen Skelton</a> and <a href=#>Molly-Mae Hague</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1.-NaturalEdit_SnuzPod_Oak.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1.-LGS_LinenKnit_StaticRoomset.jpg><p>The Scandi-inspired product comes in a wide range of colours, meaning you’re likely to find one to suit your bedroom decor.&nbsp;It also has a clever tilt recline feature which helps if your baby is prone to acid reflux.</p><p>If you’re keen for a more portable option, our mums recommended the <a href=# aria-label="Little Green Sheep Moses basket (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Little Green Sheep Moses basket</a>.</p><p>The baskets are made using palm leaf, a natural material free from chemicals and nasties, and you can also purchase a Moses basket stand which you can pop next to your bed when you go to sleep.</p><p>Make sure you also invest in a few sheets (the <a href=#>NHS</a> recommends four) and a waterproof mattress cover to cater for any unexpected accidents!</p><p>To help baby drift off, Heidi says: “A dim feeding light for night feeds is a good idea. Just make sure it emits an orange/red glow rather than white or blue light, like a phone.&nbsp;</p><p>“This will help both you and baby snooze more easily.”</p><p>Our Sun mums are a fan of <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">ewan the dream sheep</a>, which emits a warm pink calming glow and plays a selection of pink and white noise to help lull your newborn to sleep.</p><p>You can’t watch over your baby every waking minute, so many mums choose to invest in a baby monitor.</p><p>For added peace of mind, new mums rave over the <a href=# aria-label="Owlet Cam 2 and Smart Sock (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Owlet Cam 2 and Smart Sock</a> - a wearable piece of kit that slips onto your baby's foot and monitors their heart rate, oxygen level and even their sleep trends.</p><p>Watching video clips of sounds or movement before your baby cries also helps parents understand their cues and why they are uncomfortable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/owlet.webp><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bathing</strong></h2><p>Newborns generally need around three baths a week - bathing them more frequently can dry out their delicate skin.</p><p>Heidi says: “A baby bath is an essential for saving water and having to run the big bath.&nbsp;</p><p>“Go back generations and they would have just used the kitchen sink, which you still can if yours is big enough and food-free!&nbsp;</p><p>“Otherwise a cheap bathtub, such as the Shnuggle bath, is a great alternative and light enough to carry from the bathroom if you want to do bath time in a different room.”</p><p>If you’re short of storage space (or keen to keep your bathroom a kid-free zone outside of bath times) Rachel recommends the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Stokke Flexi Bath</a>.</p><p>“This is a foldable baby bath for newborns and babies,” she says. “It’s great if you’re limited with space as you can easily store it away, or even bring it with you on holiday.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/230315_STOKKE_FLEXIBATH_12_162752.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Nappies</strong></h2><p>It’s a parent’s worst nightmare - the dreaded ‘poonami’. But with disposable nappies not great for the environment, can you really trust a re-usable one?</p><p>Heidi says: “There are so many re-usable nappies on the market now and some of them are on par with disposable nappies.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you have the time and patience to keep on top of the washing, then these can be a great option - and an investment in your child’s future on this planet too!”</p><p>Similarly, it’s worth thinking about your <a href=#>carbon footprint</a> when it comes to wet wipes - and be mindful to choose a brand which is gentle, unscented and alcohol-free so it doesn’t dry out or irritate your baby’s skin.</p><p>Heidi says: “Wipes are ideally just made with water and very few additives, so that they are kind on skin.&nbsp;</p><p>“Many wipes are now biodegradable and plastic free, meaning they will break down more easily, too.”</p><p>Make sure you also pick up a barrier cream to protect your baby's skin and prevent <a href=#>nappy rash</a>.</p><p>When it comes to a changing bag, our Sun mums recommend the <a aria-label="Thule Changing Backpack (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Thule Changing Backpack</a>; it's practical as well as stylish, with intuitive pockets and comes with a padded, easy to clean changing mat and a handy 'soil bag' for dirty clothes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unnamed-2-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Getting out and about</strong></h2><p>For many parents-to-be, buying a pram is one of the biggest investments they’re likely to make - unless you're lucky enough to inherit a second-hand one!</p><p>There are a few things to bear in mind when choosing a pushchair that’s right for you and your lifestyle.</p><p>Heidi says: “Think about what you will use the pram for the majority of the time. For example, will you be pavement walking, or do you spend a lot of time walking on rough terrain in the countryside?</p><p>“You may also want to think about car boot space too, and how easy the pram is to fold up.”</p><p>The <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Joolz Geo3</a> is a popular choice among our Sun mums. When we road-tested it on the Buggy Testing Track at <a aria-label="The Baby Show (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The Baby Show</a>, it fared well on different surfaces including grass and gravel - great if you’re likely to go off-road.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/joolz-geo3.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_0030-rotated.jpg><p>Its large chunky wheels made it feel sturdy, stable and gave a smooth ride, and there’s also plenty of space for baby and all their bits! It’s also expandable and can be adapted to carry two children.</p><p>A nice touch is, for every Joolz pram purchased, the company plants a tree in one of its ‘birth forests’ in Asia, <a href=#>Africa</a>, Europe and South America.</p><p>If you live in a flat with stairs, a lightweight pram that folds easily is likely to suit you better. We liked the <a href=#>Junior Jones Aylo Stroller</a> - it features puncture-resistant tyres and is great for urban parents.</p><p>You can buy a carrycot as part of a bundle, meaning it’s suitable from birth right up to four-years-old.</p><p>If you’re after a super lightweight pram (ideal for travelling) the <a aria-label="Joolz Aer+ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Joolz Aer+</a> buggy is an impressive piece of kit. It weighs just 6kg, folds up instantly at the push of a button thanks to its clever ‘one-hand one-second fold’ system, and comes with a shoulder strap and foldable bumper bar.</p><p>On the Buggy Testing Track, we felt it had the edge over its competitor, the <a aria-label="BABYZEN YOYO2 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>BABYZEN YOYO2</a> stroller, as it felt more sturdy, though both are airline compatible.</p><p>To keep baby snug in winter, a footmuff provides a cosy insulating layer. The <a aria-label="Voksi Adventure (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Voksi Adventure</a> is super lightweight while still windproof and well-insulated, and suitable for 0–3-year-olds.</p><p>A baby carrier is also a nice option for a quick hands-free stroll with your little one, especially if you’ve a dog or another child in tow.</p><p>Heidi says: “Baby wearing has become a lot more common in the last few years, and there are huge benefits to it, including increased bonding, development and a reported increase in lower stress levels for mothers, too.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image004-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unnamed-1-1.jpg><p>“The Carifit carrier is not only stylish but also comes with an app for workouts as and when you feel ready - a double win.”</p><p>Another highly recommended carrier is the <a href=# aria-label="Baby Bjorn Harmony (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Baby Bjorn Harmony</a>, which comes in a range of stylish colours - and for the summer months, the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Infantino StayCool 4-in-1 Convertible Carrier</a> is made from a StayCool™ future-fabric proven to keep you and baby cooler.</p><p>When it comes to car seats, it’s recommended you buy new to guarantee it’s never been in an accident. It’s best to purchase one which offers rear-facing and is compatible with your pram, for added ease of getting baby in and out of the car.</p><p>We were impressed by the <a href=# aria-label="Cosatto All in All Ultra Rotate i-Size (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Cosatto All in All Ultra Rotate i-Size</a> - it has an integrated ISOFIX base and gives a seamless 360̊ rotation thanks to the rebound bar, which means no more stretching to get kids in and out, and better protection in the event of a collision.</p><p>Better still, it's suitable from birth to 12 years old, making it a sound investment for the future.</p><p>One gadget our Sun mums love is the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Rockit Rocker</a> which attaches to your pram and rocks it for you - giving your arm a rest when you're out and about!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rechargeable-Rockit-1-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Clothes</strong></h2><p>It’s easy to get carried away with baby clothes - but this is where supermarkets, charity shops and Facebook Marketplace are your friends.</p><p>Heidi says: “Vinted is brilliant for this sort of thing. Buy more than you need, as doing the washing becomes far down your list in those first few weeks, if not longer!</p><p>“Several sets of vests, babygros, and don’t forget the muslins, too.&nbsp;</p><p>“You might want to buy things like vests cheaply - supermarkets are brilliant for this sort of thing - and then invest in a few nicer babygros for daytime or special occasions.&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t go crazy though -babies grow so quickly and some are born not needing newborn size clothes at all!”</p><p>If you’re looking for something a bit special, Swedish organic children's clothing brand <a aria-label="Polarn o. Pyret (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Polarn o. Pyret</a> has some beautiful pieces which are made to last - making them a lovely hand-me-down for future generations!</p><p>It also offers a Second Hand Service where you can trade-in any PO.P item, from socks to swimwear, in exchange for a voucher to spend on a future purchase.</p><p>Heidi says: "Knowing what to buy, what to read and what advice to listen to can be extremely tricky, especially if you’re balancing your final weeks at work with hormonal changes and the ever-increasing inability to move very fast!</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"The most important thing is to ask for help when you need it, don’t put too much extra pressure on yourself by setting unreasonable targets, and listen to your body – rest when you need to rest."</p><p>The Baby Show runs from 1-3 March at the ExCel London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PoP_AW23-2_68_70cm_016_2339.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuZ2ltYmd%2FcLzAq5ynrJmjtG6x16mcq6xdo7K4ecyupKxlkpavqrHSZpqhoZyZv6a6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mini-cooper-s-found-shed-40-years-auction.html><span>←</span><span>Rare 1965 Mini Cooper S found hiding in shed for over 40 years fetches eye-watering amount at auctio</span></a>
