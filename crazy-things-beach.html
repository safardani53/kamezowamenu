It's officially summer. So it's just about that time when you try to beat the heat by heading to the beach. There's nothing quite like lying on warm sand and listening to the waves of the ocean hitting the shore to relax you.</p><p>But the beach is also notoriously filled with weird crap. Strange people doing strange things, animals acting up (specifically seagulls...those are some mean birds), and situations you never thought you'd witness in your life. The beach, like life, is like a box of chocolates... you never know what you're going to get.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>For example, you might see a T-rex sitting on the beach, contemplating their existence. I know what it's thinking, too. It's like, "Why am I so big and strong, but my arms are so tiny and weak? What kind of design is that? Who thought of this?"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I have so many questions about what it going on in this photo, but if I'm being honest with myself, my main one is: Does a Brita filter really work on sea water? I don't know. It just seems like it wouldn't.&nbsp;Perhaps he's using the force to help the filter along.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It's not every day that you witness a legit glitch in the matrix and are able to snap a picture of legit doppelgängers at the beach. They're even standing in the exact same position! This is really spooky!&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Some poor dude just woke up from a nap on the beach completely butt naked. I'm sorry. This is hilarious. This dog is the world's greatest comedian. George Carlin, Richard Pryor... they got nothing on this beach dog who stole swim trunks.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>OK, this is brilliant and I want to go to the beach now just so I can build myself a sand couch. Castles are fun to make, but they're utterly useless! Sand couches are where it's at.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This sign is amazing. Children may not be left on the beach, not because they'll be unsupervised or unable to fend for themselves, but because a beach full of children looks very "untidy." Love it. And the consequences for leaving one's children on the beach for too long can be quite harsh.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This seal is living the life! According to a commenter on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, her name is Argiro. She's very friendly, and one day, she claimed that chair on this beach in Greece to hang out and dry off. Ever since then, that chair has been reserved for her, and she often joins people on the beach to relax. She's living the life!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>These boys think they're so funny, but just wait until men can actually give birth. That will wipe those smug smiles right off their little faces.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Who knew that raccoons liked to hang out at the beach? These little trash monsters usually like hanging out in trees and under houses. But I guess in Florida, they're beach bums just like the rest of us.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Ah yes. There's nothing like heading to the shore on a hot summer's day, feeling the sand between your toes, smelling that salty sea air, and looking out upon...a virtual world. Take the headset off, kid. The ocean is pretty cool, too.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Sometimes it's so hot out that lying in the sun is way too oppressive. For those days, do what these guys did and dig yourself a little beach tub! You can even cover it with an umbrella for extra protection from the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Before you go to the beach in the morning, look in the mirror, and if you have enough chest hair, shave yourself a hairkini. I promise, it will be one of the best decisions you make. It's so good. Too good. Suspiciously good.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Come on, people! Don't drop your cigarettes on the beach. Not only is it gross, but the tuna population is completely addicted now, and I don't want to be eating tobacco with my sushi.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>How this person got four gorgeous pups to sit still and be buried for this iconic "Mt. Ruffmore" portrait, I'll never know, but one thing I do know is that this is more meaningful to me than the actual Mt. Rushmore. Like, it's no contest.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Before I saw that photo of raccoons at the beach, I would have said that seagulls are like beach raccoons. They are way too bold and they want your food. And they will do anything to get it. This kid learned a hard lesson that day, and that lesson was if you want to eat a hot dog on the beach, you better do it fast.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Have you ever wondered what all the Santas do when Christmas is over? Why, they go to the beach, of course! They just flew around the entire world delivering presents to children who probably didn't deserve them. They deserve a few months off to enjoy some sunshine.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This would be the craziest way to find out that your dog could read! You've spent all those days venting your frustration with your pup in your diary, not realizing that he was reading every single word and getting back at you by pooping on the carpet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please forgive me for this, but when a pig on the beach gets sunburned, does it start to smell like bacon? Like I said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!!!! I should not have said anything!!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>You don't normally think of huskies as beach dogs, but I've never seen a group of dogs look more comfortable in my entire life. They are clearly loving life right now, and I don't blame them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>That is one obnoxiously large beach towel, and I love it. I mean, it's an extremely rude move at a busy beach, but I can't help but respect it. Beach towels are never big enough! Until now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2Bixthmq6GhnpzAbq7Empqh</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spartan-race-uk-dates-where-can-you-take-part-how-do-you-enter-and-how-much-money-is-up-for-grabs.html><span>←</span><span>Spartan Race UK dates: where can you take part, how do you enter and how much money is up for grabs?</span></a>
