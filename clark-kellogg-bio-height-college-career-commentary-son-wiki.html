At the same time, the American-born belongs to the black ethnicity.</p><p>Additionally, he enrolled in Chambers Elementary and later transferred to St. Joseph’s High School.</p><p>When in High School, Kellogg developed a passion for basketball. With skills for the sport, he received a college grant and subsequently attended Ohio State University.</p><p>Thereafter, Clark gave a praiseworthy performance for his college team, and in 1982, Indiana Pacers drafted him in an 8th overall pick.</p><h2>Clark Kellogg Age, Height, Body Stats | How old is Clark Kellogg?</h2><p>The former basketball player is 58-years old and is still fresh like he was in his youth years. Further, the Cleveland native stands at an astounding height of 6’8″ (2.03 m). It shouldn’t be astonishing as fans know how tall basketball players can be.</p><p>With that in mind, Clark weighs approximately 102.1 kg (225 lbs).</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Lewandowski Bio: Age, Height, Stats, Club, Career, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>With a tall stature and an incredible build, Kellogg was a valued asset of his team, the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>In like manner, he wouldn’t be an established player if he did not have the favorable height and athleticism necessary to play for the professional team.</p><p>Despite him not being the most popular player, Kellogg has built recognition through his past records and present as an adept game analyst.</p><h2>Clark Kellogg | Career: Basketball & Broadcasting | What does Clark Kellogg do for a living?</h2><h3>Basketball Career</h3><p>Dubbed as “Gentle Giant” throughout his career, Clark significantly impacted the sport during his tenure. Besides, Kellogg is active in the scene since 1979.</p><p>Loving a sport is one thing but actively devoting time to something you are passionate about is an entirely different thing. The Gentle Giant never disappointed.</p><p>To begin with, the American started playing basketball with his college team. During that time, he recorded 79 wins to 65 losses.</p><p>Similarly, in a game against Columbus East, Clark scored 51 points with 24 rebounds reception. In addition, the forward also participated in McDonald’s All-American and Capital Classic Games.</p><p>Afterward, Kellogg ventured into college life, where he had the opportunity to represent Ohio State University. In particular, the American received All-Big Ten Conference and MVP honors with the college team.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariusz Pudzianowski Bio: Height, Wife, UFC Career, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>As an honorary member, Kellogg sits as a board of trustees for the university appointed by then-Governor <strong>Ted Strickland</strong> in 2010.</p><p>With an amazing run for his college team, Clark wanted to play as a professional and listed himself for the NBA draft.</p><p>Luckily enough, Indiana Pacers selected him in the 1st round as an 8th overall pick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/clark-512.jpg><p>Furthermore, in his first season as a Pacers player, Kellogg landed an NBA All-Rookie Team membership.</p><p>The American is the only rookie to score an average of 20 points and grab 10 rebounds in a game.</p><p>Pundits, fans, coaches lauded his performance and regarded him to be the future star in basketball. Likely so, Kellogg’s could make it big had it not been for a chronic knee <a href=#>injury</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Clark had an endorsement deal with Converse and agreed upon releasing his signature Special K sneakers.</p><p>However, his dream of making it big was cut short when he was forced to retire after the third season with the Pacers.</p><p>Having announced retirement after 5 years since the dawn of his career, the former forward only managed to play three full seasons for the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>Moreover, the Pacers forward had a 68-178 record for the team.</p><h3>Broadcasting Career</h3><p>His career in broadcasting ranges from ESPN, Big East Network, to Prime Sports.</p><p>For CBS Sports, Clark served from 1993 to 1994. Most prominently, he covered the games for the NCAA Tournament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/clark-508.jpg><p>Three years later, CBS offered him a full-time position to cover college games and host March Madness alongside <a href=#><strong>Greg Gumbel</strong></a> and <strong>Seth Davis.</strong></p><p>Likewise, during coverages, any person would identify Kellogg without seeing him because of his repetitive use of the phrase “spurtability,” referring to the teams that take points in rapid succession.</p><p>Further, in the 2008 to 2009 season, Clark stepped in for <strong>Billy Packer</strong> as the head game analyst.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Ho-Sang Bio: Parents, Hockey Teams, Career, Contracts Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>Alongside <strong><a href=#>Jim Nantz</a>,</strong> the former player covered the 2009 NCAA Men’s Basketball Championship.</p><p>In the same way, Clark would break down game stats with <strong>Verne Lundquist</strong> whenever Nantz had other duties to tend to. In 2010, <strong>President Barack Obama</strong> invited the ESPN announcer to play a game of H.O.R.S.E.</p><p>Finally, in 2012, a proud moment for Kellogg as he covered the Ohio Bobcats, his son’s team.</p><p>At that time, while covering another game between Lehigh and Xavier, he discovered that the Bobcats won, and he deviated from his unbiased role as a commentator and celebrated his son’s win.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/clark-509.jpg><p>Nonetheless, it had no impact on his broadcasting career. In 2014, the ex-NBA and <a href=#><strong>Greg Anthony</strong> </a>swapped roles, and Kellogg now worked as a studio analyst.</p><p>Apart from playing and broadcasting, Clark is prominent for lending his voice for the NBA 2K video game series as a commentator.</p><h2>Clark Kellogg | Basketball Stats</h2><p>Career stats</p><table class="vk_tbl Uekwlc"><tbody><tr><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Games played"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Minutes per game"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Points per game"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Field goal percentage"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="3 point percentage"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Rebounds per game"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Assists per game"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Steals per game"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Blocks per game"></th></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Clark Kellogg Net Worth | Salary & Income</h2><p>Clark’s career spans 40 years.
