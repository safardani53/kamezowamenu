The entire dress, which was monochromatic, was covered in sparkles, but we can imagine that most eyes were on the parts of the dress that had missing pieces — if you know what we mean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/anita-american-music-awards-amas-2022-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Anyway, to accessorize her look, Anitta, 29, wore Tiffany & Co. earrings in platinum with diamonds, Elsa Peretti® cuffs and several diamond rings.

The Rio de Janeiro native recently made history at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards after winning the Best Latin award for her track, “Envolver.” With that win, Anitta became the first Brazilian performer to win a MTV VMA. She’s also nominated for an AMA this evening, and she’ll then move into 2023 with a possible win at the Grammys — she’s nominated for Best New Artist at the 65th Grammy Awards!
