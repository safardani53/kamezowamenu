Huffman was released on a $250,000 bond, while Macy has yet to be indicted.</p><p>The&nbsp;American Crime&nbsp;alum allegedly “made a purported charitable contribution of $15,000 … to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter.” She later allegedly “made arrangements to pursue the scheme for a second time” but decided against it.</p><p>Huffman and Macy, who tied the knot in 1997, share daughters Sofia, 18, and Georgia, 17.</p><p>The couple have yet to comment on the allegations. However, the&nbsp;Fargo&nbsp;actor <a href=#>spoke out about the college admissions process</a> days before the actress’ arrest. “We talk showbiz. My daughter, Sofia, the oldest, she’s in the tribe. She’s going to be an actor,” he told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;on March 6. “She goes to LACHSA, the arts high school here, and we’re doing the college tour, and she’s looking at theater schools.&nbsp;So yeah, we talk about it a lot.”</p><p>Macy also noted that the girls are “crazy for their mom,” adding: “She’s a great mom. She’s kind of astounding. … I’m the luckiest guy on the planet.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Huffman’s website and online store,&nbsp;What the Flicka?, <a href=#>appeared shut down</a> in the wake of the scandal.
