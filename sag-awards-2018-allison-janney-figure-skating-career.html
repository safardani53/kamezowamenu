I wasn’t very good,” Janney, 58, said. “I was actually very graceful but it’s really an acrobatic sport. I’m 6 feet tall. I maybe could’ve been an ice dancer, but I could maybe do two double jumps, but that’s it. You have to be compact and small and a gymnast almost. It just wasn’t my thing. That’s the short answer.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i><strong>Be sure to check out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE’s full SAG Awards coverage</a> to get the latest news on Hollywood’s big night and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>watch PEOPLE,</a></strong></i> <strong>Entertainment Weekly<i> and TNT’s official live red carpet show on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Twitter</a> or your favorite streaming devices.</i></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Janney did end up being tied to figure skating thanks to her role as Tonya Harding’s mother in I, Tonya.
