I love him very much. This man has brought me a lot of joy and pain.</p><p>“My love life has been a lot more turbulent than I’ve ever let on, and I’m so sad about my relationship with Kenny. I’m sorry for any pain.”</p><p>Kenny says George’s spiraling drug use led to clashes, with George hitting back over his lover’s boozing.</p><p>Kenny&nbsp;said: “When I confronted him, he never denied it, never apologised. He was hard on me about drinking, because I developed a problem.”</p><p>However,&nbsp;Kenny continued to support his ex, accompanying George on a court appearance in 2010 and visiting him in an Austrian hospital when he contracted pneumonia in 2011.</p><p>The singer wrote “Where I Hope You Are” about his former lover, with lyrics that said:&nbsp;“For so long there’s been no-one else I care about. That my heart could really be so wrong again, well it wears me out. I had a picture in my soul, some place warm we could hang out when we’re old. Now it’s just – where I hope you are.”</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a> in 2022, Kenny revealed that they broke up in part due to substance abuse and alcoholism and that he was always worried about him.</p><p>He explained: "We all expected him to die. I had spent so much time when we lived together, being worried about him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"Honestly, he hated the fact that I worried about him so much. What's the line he says in one of his songs? He says, "I can see it in your eyes when you look at me that way, it tears me in two". And it really did. I just didn't know what to do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"I was worried about him all the time. Please don't say that the wrong way, if you love someone you are worried about them."</p><h2>What happened in the weeks leading up to George Michael’s death?</h2><p><a href=#>George</a> went through some of the darkest times of his life in the years following their split, culminating in a lengthy stint in the world’s most expensive rehab clinic in Switzerland.</p><p>The former Wham! star had been dating Australian-born celebrity hair stylist <a href=#>Fadi Fawaz</a>, who he met soon after the breakdown of him and Kenny’s relationship.</p><p>However, friends of Kenny and George told The Sun how the pair had rekindled their friendship, sparking hopes of a romantic reunion.</p><p>A close friend revealed: “George and Kenny are back spending time together again and it’s an exciting time for those of us who have been so worried over the last few years.”</p><p>Pals believe George’s long-awaited music comeback would have been more likely if his relationship with Kenny had come to fruition.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Fight for humanity</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Kenny spoke out to raise the profile of the pair’s charitable Goss-Michael Foundation. He has not been paid for this interview, but The Sun on Sunday has made a donation to the foundation (g-mf.org).</p><p>The foundation was set up by the pair in 2007 and supports causes including hunger relief and HIV prevention.<br>It plans to raise awareness of mental health issues and back those with addiction problems. UK charities and projects will also be supported.</p><p>Its annual MTV RE:DEFINE event has raised more than £9.25million for HIV and Aids prevention.</p><p>Money also goes towards Project Angel Food, which feeds the sick, and Advocacy Right which backs domestic violence victims and funds shelters.</p><p>For more information and to donate <a href=# data-mce-href=http://www.g-mf.org/index.php/info/ rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>.</p><h2>Did Kenny Goss attend George Michael's funeral?</h2><p>Three months <a href=#>after his death on Christmas Day</a>, legendary singer <a href=#>George Michael was finally laid to rest in North London</a>, and Kenny was <a href=#>among the small number of guests</a>.</p><p>A service, attended by family and close friends, was held in the tiny, 30-seat chapel at <a href=#>Highgate West </a>Cemetery, and took place amid tight security.</p><p>Family in attendance included George’s feather Kyriacos and <a href=#>sisters Melanie</a> and Panayiota.</p><p>Among the other guests were former bandmates <a href=#>Andrew Ridgeley</a>, Helen “Pepsi” DeMacque and Shirlie Holliman, as well as Spandau Ballet star <a href=#>Martin Kemp</a>.</p><p>Also in attendance was <a href=#>Fadi Fawaz</a>, the singer’s boyfriend, who had been expected to be excluded from proceedings.</p><p>Mourners were able to walk up to the closed coffin and Kenny said: “I didn’t cry. I just thought, ‘That’s him in there.</p><p>"I pictured him being younger — aged 33 in an amazing suit with his Cartier watch on. I touched the coffin. It was reassuring to know he was resting in peace.”</p><h2>Did he get anything in George Michael's will?</h2><p>Michael left £ 97.6 million to his sisters, his dad and a string of friends — <a href=#>but snubbed lovers Kenny Goss</a> and Fadi Fawaz.</p><p>His will confirms the bulk of his estate goes to sisters<a href=#> Yioda and Melanie</a>.</p><p>George’s dad Kyriacos was left a horseracing stud farm where he has lived for many years.</p><p>A source said: “George was devoted to his dad and sisters, they were always going to be looked after.”</p><p>Court paperwork issued on May 30 means the estate can finally be divided more than two years after&nbsp;<a href=#>George’s death on Christmas Day 2016</a>.</p><p>Seven pals and relatives including <a href=#>Shirlie Kemp</a>, a backing singer with his band Wham!, and record producer David Austin, are also beneficiaries.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More on The Sun</h2></p><p>In 2021,<a href=#> Michael’s estate agreed on a financial settlement with Goss,</a> after he had demanded payments of £15,000 a month.</p><p>Goss had sued the estate under the Inheritance Act 1975, which states that those who were previously financially dependent on someone to claim from their estate even if they are left out of the will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqZGyGdIGVaJ6ep6Kcsm65yJyfmp2cYrK5ecqepaexXZy8tL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./m9scljd18wfojqylxvektqcl7kqwpoec.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Black Ink Crew Chicago Season 7 Episode 15: It's All Relative</span></a>
