Back then, Timothy was quite the "artsy jock," ruling the swim team scene. But he wasn't the superstar we all know and love just yet — fame hadn't caught up with him, but Alexis did, and the pair hit it off.</p><p>In a conversation with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Women’s Health</a>, Timothy spilled the tea on the secret behind their decades-long relationship. “You have to be with the right person, and you both have to be willing to do the work, day in and day out, to make it happen," the actor said at the time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Although we know the famous actor well, Alexis tends to maintain her privacy, and stays out of the limelight as much as possible. However, thanks to Timothy, we have heard about her wicked wit in a few interviews. Although Alexis is like a ninja in the shadows who prefers to keep a low profile while her husband takes the spotlight, she seems to still make a huge impression on the Justified: City Primeval star.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Timothy and Alexis have three adult children.</h2><p>The lovebirds tied the knot way back in 1991 and have been rocking the married life ever since. They didn't stop at just being an amazing couple; they went on to raise three kids together. Their kids are Grace, a luxury fashion stylist, Henry, and Vivian, a budding actor.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@graceolyphant</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Timothy and Alexis's daughter Vivian is also in 'Justified: City Primeval.'</h2><p>Speaking of Vivian, she joined her Dad in Justified: City Primeval in what seems to be the ultimate acting debut! Her father is very proud. In a conversation with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, Timothy opened up about what it was like working with his daughter.</p><p>The actor shared, "One of the things about Justified in particular is that, over time, you've earned a little bit of a reputation where perhaps people … can be a little nervous around you or feel intimidated," the actor said. "We hired the one person, guaranteed, who doesn't feel that way at all. In fact, she's not only not nervous around me, she's kinda over it."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>We are excited to see what is in Vivian's future. Before her acting debut, Vivian was actually an acting student at none other than the famous William Esper Studio! She has also dabbled in songwriting. She honed her music skills at the renowned <a href=#>Berklee College of Music</a>! I mean, come on, who wouldn't be impressed by that? We can't wait to see what's next for her, and the Olyphant clan in general.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauu9OhsGannK69qa3NrWSwoZaaeqWt1KCfrZ2i</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-oliver-actor.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Michael Oliver (actor) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
