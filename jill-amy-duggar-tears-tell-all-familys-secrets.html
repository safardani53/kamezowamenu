they expose all the secrets of their former life in the Institute in Basic Life Principles community.</p><p>Amazon Prime released a trailer for their new series, <a href=# aria-label="Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets</a>, on Thursday.</p><p>In scenes from the upcoming tell-all, set for release on June 2, Jill and her husband Derick Dillard could be seen opening up to show producers.</p><p>The mother of three was filmed sitting on a couch, grasping her husband's hand with tears in her eyes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Jill Duggar">Read more on Jill Duggar</h2><p>Production could be heard in the background, saying: "Thank you for agreeing to talk to us," as Jill looked woefully down at her pregnant belly.</p><p>As pictures of the Duggar family appeared on the screen, the former TLC star could be heard saying: "There's a story that's going to be told and I would rather be the one telling it."</p><p>Later in the video, Amy, daughter of Duggar patriarch Jim Bob's sister Deanna, added her own testimony.</p><p>"Everyone knew who the family was," she explained in the trailer.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Jill then chimed back in: "We were in IBLP as early as I can remember."</p><h2>BREAKING FREE</h2><p>Jill Duggar is the fourth child of <a href=#>Jim Bob</a>, 57, and <a href=#>Michelle</a>, 56, who share 19 children in total.</p><p>The TV personality tied the knot with her husband Derick Dillard, 34, in 2014, and the pair share three children of their own: Israel, seven, Samuel, five, and Frederick, 10 months.</p><p>In September 2020, the family's spinoff show, <a href=#>Counting On</a>, was canceled after allegations arose that Josh molested four of his sisters, as well as a babysitter.</p><p>In the years since Jill has estranged herself from the rest of the family, even going as long as a two-year period without speaking to her parents.</p><h2>FAMILY FEUD</h2><p>In March of 2021, the brunette told fans that she <a href=#>hadn't visited her childhood home in years</a>, and spoke about the major changes she implemented in her absence.</p><p>"We just feel like in this season of life we have to prioritize our like mental and emotional health and all that," she confessed in a scathing YouTube video.</p><p>The young parents have rebelled against&nbsp;<a href=#>Jim Bob</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Michelle</a>, and the rest of the family over the last few years after the patriarch of the&nbsp;<a href=#>family withheld compensation</a>&nbsp;from them for their appearances on Counting On.</p><h2>MODERN CHRISTIANS</h2><p>Jill, as well as Amy and her own husband, have since adopted a much more relaxed lifestyle, forsaking some modesty and the parent's strict rulings.</p><p>Derick spoke exclusively to The U.S. Sun in June of 2020 about their deviation from the rest of the family, as he claimed that at the time,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jim Bob prohibited them from visiting the house unless he was present</a>.</p><p>“I think he’s mainly worried about the influence we might have on his children," the father of two shared.</p><p>Jill has added&nbsp;<a href=#>pants and tank tops to her wardrobe</a>, though normally the Duggar women are limited to skirts and long-sleeves.</p><p>They've also&nbsp;<a href=#>chosen to enroll their children in public school</a>, though the family standard is homeschooling.</p><p>Jill's newer lifestyle choices have also&nbsp;<a href=#>caused a rift between the star and her 18 siblings</a>, as her husband divulged previously: “Because our visitation to the Duggar house has been restricted and that is where they and their spouses hang out, we have not been able to see other family as much as we would like, so that is difficult.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on

We hope and pray God would restore relationships where there is brokenness."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/michelle-duggar-like-little-girl-795967760-9.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/duggar-family-famous-featured-tlc-594379903.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/smiles-pregnant-jill-duggar-shows-733110637.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYWp%2FdH2WaKGipJxirq7FjJ2soJ%2BRp3q1scCrqmaslaG5bq3LpWSfmZ2eubq%2FjKycnKqVqcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./future-cheating-ciara-tinashe-fling-relationship-hookup.html><span>←</span><span>Future Cheating On Ciara With Tinashe?
