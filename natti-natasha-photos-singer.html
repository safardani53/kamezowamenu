The singer got her start performing in church as a child and her mother soon recognized her talents, enrolling her at the School of Fine Arts of Santiago. Natasha eventually formed a music group with her friends, D’style, and it didn’t take long until Reggaeton superstar Don Omar scouted the singer. Don proved to be the ultimate mentor for Natasha, who wound up in New York City to work with him at his studio. The two eventually recorded a duet single “Dutty Love,” in 2012, and she joined him on tour. In 2018, Natasha was the most watched woman on YouTube, beating out the likes of Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift. She was the most nominated artist of the night at the 2019 Premio Lo Nuestro awards, where she took home four awards. She also won the Hot Latin Songs Artist of the Year, Female, award at the 2019 Billboard Latin Music Awards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLuiwNOiZKeZpJbAqa2MqZ%2BorJ%2BoerS1zaCcq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-eddie-murphy-engaged-paige-butcher.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Murphy Is Engaged!
