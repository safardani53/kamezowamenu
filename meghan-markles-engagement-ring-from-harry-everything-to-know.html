From the original to the wedding band and redesign, the gorgeous rock is a must-see.</p><p>In 2017, Harry, 38, popped the question to the Suits alum, 41, with a <a href=#>three-stone diamond</a>, which was designed by the British royal himself. The impressive rock features two stones from <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s jewelry collection with the center diamond coming from Botswana — a country that holds special significance to Harry because he visited many times there as a child. It is also where the couple spent a significant amount of time during the early stages of their romance.</p><p>The public got its first glance at the jewel when the couple announced their engagement in the Sunken Gardens at Kensington Palace on November 27 of that year. Markle was a glowing sight as she flashed the piece to cameras while wearing an emerald green frock from P.A.R.O.S.H., fittingly named “The Megan.” She paired the bow-adorned number with a white wrap coat by Line the Label. Harry, for his part, looked dapper in a blue suit.</p><p>In the couple’s Netflix docuseries, <a href=#>Harry & Meghan</a> — which premiered in December 2022, four years after their wedding and nearly two years after they announced their decision to <a href=#>step back as senior royals</a> — the Spare author and California native opened up about <a href=#>the moment Harry got down on one knee</a>.</p><p>“I wanted to do it earlier, because I had to ask permission from my grandmother, [Queen Elizabeth II],” the Duke of Sussex recalled in episode 2 of the show, detailing his plans to propose. “I couldn’t do it outside of the U.K.”</p><p>Harry described the romantic setup he made in the garden, which included 15 battery-powered candles. The episode then cut to Meghan excitedly calling what appeared to be her former BFF<strong> Jessica Mulroney</strong>.</p><p>“Oh, my God, Jess … it’s happening, it’s happening, it’s happening! Oh, my God, he told me not to peek,” Meghan said before a photo of Harry asking for her hand panned over the screen.</p><p>Off camera, a producer asked “what position” the prince was in when he asked Meghan to marry him. “Downward dog,” he joked. “Of course, I got down on one knee. Of course, I did.”</p><p>The Bench author went on to gush that they were both “so joyful and excited” in the moment. “I was like, ‘Ah, we’re doing this!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the years that followed, Meghan’s ring <a href=#>underwent a few changes</a> following their nuptials and the 2019 birth of their son <a href=#>Archie</a>. The lovebirds also share <a href=#>daughter Lilibet</a>, who they welcomed in 2021.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn every detail about Meghan’s engagement ring:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnp6hmZ5iuqK%2ByqWcrGWVo7Sis8SmnKesXae2r7OMn6mopV2drrO%2B2Gacr52irsGptc2gZK2nXaC7sMOO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hollywood-icon-paul-newman-volvo-up-for-sale.html><span>←</span><span>Hollywood icon Paul Newman's amazing Volvo up for sale - it could be yours for around 22,000</span></a>
