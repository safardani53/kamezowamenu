He was sentenced to life in prison but he was released in February 2017 after accepting a plea deal.</p><p>“I was contacted by a man who I would later come to know as Michael Peterson,” Wolgamott said. “I would later figure out that our emails would become a lot more important to my life story than I would have realized.”</p><p>Crime journalist Diane Dimond analyzed the correspondence and explained, “You take one look at those emails between Michael Peterson and the male prostitute and you see the constant communication.”</p><p>The clip ends with Wolgamott saying, “We had tried to arrange a time where I was going to be in Durham at the same time he was going to be available to do a call,” noting that the date they agreed on was September 5, 2001, just two months before Kathleen was found dead.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The death of Kathleen Peterson is one of the most confounding cases in history,” Henry Schleiff, group president of Investigation Discovery, American Heroes Channel and Destination America said in a statement. “There are so many pieces to this puzzle – from Michael’s salacious secrets to investigator misconduct to the odd owl theory.”</p><p>Watch the exclusive preview above and catch American Murder Mystery: The Staircase on ID Sunday, April 8, at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinZZGisrO1wpqlZqWlp7GmvoymsKyslafGbrnInJ%2BanZxivabAxKuqqKZdmrqitcuem2alkaGybrHSnKarrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frito-lays-super-bowl-2022-commercial.html><span>←</span><span>Who stars in the Frito-Lays Super Bowl commercial?</span></a>
