He draws inspiration from his Trinidian-Jamaican heritage and creates with crisp elegance and vivid colors from a culturally-hybrid perspective.&nbsp;In 2020, he launched his eponymous brand, which quickly gained worldwide acclaim, attracting A-list celebrities such as Dua Lipa, Rihanna, and Kim Kardashian.&nbsp;Maximilian Davis learned to sew from his grandmother and founded the label from his bedroom in Seven Sisters. Davis has worked with Grace Wales Bonner, Asai, Mowalola, and Supriya Lele before founding his own label.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Maximilian-Davis-2.jpg alt="Maximilian Davis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Maximilian Davis just debuted his collection with Fashion East at London Fashion Week, including crisp fitted items, beautiful tiny skirts, Nappa cropped jackets, and opulent suede trench coats. The arrival of Salvatore Ferragamo ushers in a new era for Davis and the Florentine label.&nbsp;Marco Gobbetti, the firm’s recently appointed CEO, reacted to Maximilian Davis’ debut on the label, stating,</p><p>“I am happy to welcome Maximilian to the Ferragamo House.” His vision clarity, degree of execution, and tremendous aesthetic combine to make him one of the most brilliant geniuses of his time. His art is distinguished by its elegance, delicate sensuality, and unwavering attention to excellence. He will create a new, exciting chapter for this house established on a tradition of innovation, craftsmanship, refinement, and exceptional human values through the prism of his modern perspective.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Maximilian-Davis-3.jpg alt="Maximilian Davis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>By appointing a young black creative representative in the fashion company, the Ferragamo label has made a positive step. Davis was also appreciative of the role, which he acknowledged in a news statement issued by the Ferragamo company, adding,</p><p>“I am profoundly thrilled to be joining Ferragamo and appreciative for the chance to contribute to the house’s rich and significant tradition.” Ferragamo exemplifies a commitment to ageless beauty and refinement that I find really motivating. I’m excited to share my idea, which has been elevated by the codes of Italian workmanship, quality, and innovation.”</p><p>The British-Trinidadian designer has also lately earned a name for himself as one of the semi-finalists for this year’s LVHM award. He was one of twenty designers nominated for the LVMH award for young designers. However, he opted out of the competition before the exhibition opened in Paris.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmrCZorattcCnZJ2Zpp7Abq2MnZysoZejsrN5wKmnqKGeqbKlecCsZKyZnKuutbvRnmSfnaKnrqitzKhknKqVlsGqwsRmm6KqlZjBsL6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-kims-daughter-royal-reign-makes-red-carpet-debut-w212660.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Kim's Daughter, Royal Reign, Makes Red Carpet Debut</span></a>
