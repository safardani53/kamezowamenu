During her multi-season stint on The Real Housewives of Orange County, Rossi was accustomed to shaking off her many haters, including her former costar and on-screen enemy <strong>Tamra Barney</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Rossi was fired from the Housewives franchise in fall 2013, but the future Mrs<strong>. Slade Smiley </strong>told<strong> Us Weekly</strong> this past month at the Josh Duhamel Relief Run For Nepal benefit in Santa Monica, Calif., that she has been keeping busy with wedding planning.</p><p>“We keep changing the date like 28 times. It’s so bad,” Rossi told <strong>Us</strong> of pushing back plans. “You know what, honestly, every single time we start planning and thinking that we’re going to make it happen, something comes up or somebody can’t make it in the family or just something… It’s so funny because at this point, I’m like, screw it. We’re just going to like go elope. Because like every time we have a plan or have something, it always is like getting messed up. And we feel like we’ve been married because we’ve been together for six years. So eventually, one day, we’ll get married [laughs].”</p><p>In the meantime, the two have been enjoying each other’s company since their controversial romance panned out on the series. “The couple that plays together, stays together,” Rossi joked with Us. “We love just working out and taking care of ourselves. So it’s fun that we both enjoy it. And he got me a road bike just recently, and so we’re out riding road bikes now. And I’m kicking his butt.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added of date nights: “[We] sit out back by the fireplace and have a glass of wine and probably watch a movie. We just love being together. We can literally be watching paint dry, and if we’re together, it’s fun. The bottom line is, that we’re just best friends, so we just want to be together all the time, and we’re lucky that we have that.”</p><p>Smiley chimed in, “We are lucky. We’re so lucky. And she looks cute in running stuff.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagqpWpsKmxzWapqKujnnq0tMCknKxln5uzbrTEq2ShmaSav7R51qKroWWklsatu9FmqrChlql6rbXPZqqyppNiw6qwxKhka2hhan92gY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lincoln-melcher-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Lincoln Melcher Dating Now</span></a>
