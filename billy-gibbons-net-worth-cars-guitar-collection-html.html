Under the hood, it has an old French-built V8 flathead.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Gibbons with his Highboy</strong><strong> </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Allposters</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>2. 1933 Ford Coupe - 'Eliminator'</h3><p>One of the&nbsp;earliest custom cars in his collection is the&nbsp;1933 Ford Coupe or the 'Eliminator.' It&nbsp;was featured on&nbsp;two of the ZZ Top&nbsp;album covers and has appeared in a few of the&nbsp;band’s music videos.</p><h3>3.&nbsp;1933 Ford Coupe - 'Wiskeyrunner'</h3><p>The Ford Coupe&nbsp;'Wiskeyrunner' is yet another unique car in his&nbsp;collection. An interesting feature of it is the&nbsp;jagged line that runs&nbsp;from the front to back. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>4. 1936 Ford&nbsp;- 'Mambo Coupé'</h3><p>The&nbsp;'Mambo Coupé' is a three-window coupe named after a box full of Hawaiian shirts found in the vehicle's trunk. It has a screaming chrome skull on the front grille.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h3>5. 1936 Ford Truck - 'Rat Rod'</h3><p>The Ford model called Rat Rod Model caught the celebrated vocalist's&nbsp;eye because of its&nbsp;rat rod look with&nbsp;custom hot rod function. It has a '53 Ford flathead engine,&nbsp; a 6-inch drop tube front axle, and an 8-inch rear end with buggy springs and air shocks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>6. 1948 Cadillac Series 62 - 'CadZZilla'</h3><p>Gibbons&nbsp;calls his&nbsp;Cadillac Sedanette- 'CadZZilla,' a mix of early post-war&nbsp;Cadillac design customized by&nbsp;Larry Erickson, Boyd Coddington, and Craig Naff. It has a custom deep purple paint scheme with&nbsp;a unique interior and has a custom Holley fuel injection system and headers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Gibbons in&nbsp;his CadZZilla</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CarThrottle</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3>7.1950 Ford Business Coupe - 'Kopperhed'</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He has named the&nbsp;Coupe 'Kopperhed' due to its copper and black color combination, which resembles a&nbsp;rattlesnake. It is based on the ’50 five-window business coupe&nbsp;that has been altered&nbsp;into a three-window.</p><h3>8. 1958 Ford Thunderbird -&nbsp;‘The Mexican Blackbird’</h3><p>The vintage Ford is called ‘The Mexican Blackbird’ due to a song of&nbsp;the same name.&nbsp;</p><h3>9. 1962 Chevrolet Impala - 'Slampala'</h3><p>He has named his Impala 'Slampala' by combining two slang terms, slammed and Impala. Its unique features include a modern air-ride suspension, which&nbsp;allows the car to be set to extremely low ground clearance.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>He Owns Over 450 Guitars</h2><p>He has a massive guitar collection of over 450 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">guitars</a>. Some of these guitars are: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3>1. 1962 Gibson Melody Maker</h3><p>This was his&nbsp;first electric guitar, which he got as a Christmas present at the age of 13.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>2. 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard 'Pearly Gates'</h3><p>This guitar was his&nbsp;first Les Paul, which he named 'Pearly Gates.' The guitarist is especially attached to 'Pearly Gates', so much so that he refused to sell it even when he had an offer for $5 million.&nbsp;</p><p>It&nbsp;has appeared on most albums Gibbons&nbsp;has recorded with ZZ-top since he first got it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p></p><p><strong>A few guitars from Gibbons' collection</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">VintageGuitar</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h3>3. Gibson Les Paul Gold-top</h3><p>It&nbsp;is a&nbsp;custom made pinstriped Les Paul, whose aging and pin-striping Gibbons&nbsp;did himself.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. 1961 Gibson SG</h3><p>The Gibson SG&nbsp;was featured on ZZ Top’s 2012 album La Futura <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><h3>5. Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird</h3><p>This&nbsp;was a gift from&nbsp;Bo Diddley and has been featured in the&nbsp;Mescalero&nbsp;album in 2003.&nbsp;</p><h3>6.&nbsp;1958 Gibson Flying V</h3><p>It has been featured on the cover of 'Fandango!'.</p><h3>7.&nbsp;1955 Fender Stratocaster</h3><p>Gibbons'&nbsp;played this guitar on the recording of 'La Grange.'&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>8. 1952 Fender Broadcaster</h3><p>He played&nbsp;this on 'Jesus Just Left Chicago'&nbsp;from the Tres Hombres album.</p><p>The other guitars in the collection include&nbsp;John Bolin Supermodel Esquire,&nbsp;John Bolin Broadcaster,&nbsp;1983 Gibson Explorer, and his big furry guitar rig&nbsp;Bolin/Gretsch Bo Diddley.&nbsp;</p><h2>His Life Beyond Cars And Guitars</h2><p>From his car and guitar collection, it sure seems like that is all he cares about. Even though it may be partly true, he does have a wonderful personal life too.&nbsp;</p><p>Gibbons has been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married </a>to the love of his life&nbsp;Gilligan&nbsp;Stillwater since 2005. Although&nbsp;they have been together for a long time, they do&nbsp;not have any children together.&nbsp;The couple lives in a beautiful <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">house</a> in Houston, Texas.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e2rbjYZp6impKku7R5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecKaqaxll6q2ta3RZpqopJyasLW1zqdloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-mike-yung-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mike Yung Dating Now</span></a>
