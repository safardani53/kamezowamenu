However, the pandemic caused the travel enthusiast to shut down his business and hunker down.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But Steves didn’t moan about not getting to travel. Instead, he used the time to expand his knowledge about things and try activities out that he either had no time or interest in while he was busy at work.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Effect of Pandemic on Steves' Business</h2><p><a href=# rel=follow>Rick Steves</a> has a reported net worth of around $10 million that results from his travel business. His travel business,&nbsp;Rick Steves’ Europe, used to take over&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">30000 people</a>&nbsp;to Europe annually, bringing around $100 million in revenue per annum before the pandemic. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the coronavirus outbreak and lockdown hit Steves hard as his travel business could not operate. It has about 100 office staff, currently with millions of dollars in expenses and no revenue. As there was no surety about when the world would get back to normalcy, Steves <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cut</a> the&nbsp;payroll dramatically&nbsp;to fund the company for&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two years</a>&nbsp;or longer with no revenue. He even fully refunded trip payments to all prepaid customers for 2020.</p><h2>Rick Steves Is Exploring His Life without Travelling</h2><p>As an adventurous person, the current situation has compelled him to be interested in things that he had neglected in his life. He&nbsp;learned to cook&nbsp;and playing the piano, which he didn’t have time for or interest in.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Steves seems optimistic, even in the time of crisis. He expanded on the way he was looking at his life without travel, saying, “So I am proving to myself that the way travel gives more colors to your palette, staying home with a traveler’s mindset can bring more colors to your palette as well.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Steves Fell in Love with Traveling at Young Age</h2><p>Steves' first traveled to Europe with his parents at 14, intending to improve their&nbsp;piano store. However, the trip changed the way he viewed traveling, and he was hooked instantly.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Instead of going into his family business, he went with traveling. He started teaching travel classes to spread his love for exploration. In 1979, Steve wrote his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first book</a>,&nbsp;Europe Through the Back Door.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In 2000 he started his second&nbsp;travel show,&nbsp;Rick Steves’ Europe,&nbsp;where he shared tips about traveling on a budget, finding hidden gems of Europe, and sharing information about countries he traveled. The show became popular and is still running. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Steves has a unique philosophy on travel, which makes him stand out from others; he believes that you have to become a temporary local to truly experience a destination. He recommends drifting away from the touristy places and visiting small villages and restaurants.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He Spends Four Months a Year in Europe</h2><p>Steves’ passion for traveling can be seen in his lifestyle. He spends&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">four months</a>&nbsp;a year in Europe, researching guidebooks, improving his tour programs, filming his TV show, and discovering new and hidden gems of Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>His Europe tours are famous for prioritizing small businesses, family-owned restaurants, people-to-people interactions, and activities that encourage friendship with locals. So far, he has published over&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">50 guidebooks</a>,&nbsp;Rick Steves’ Europe&nbsp;is in its 11th season, he hosts a public radio show, and he is a prolific writer for a newspaper. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e2pLeMrKuerpWoeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqxrc2dnKahk2O1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./garth-brooks-republican-democrat-joe-biden-inauguration.html><span>←</span><span>Is Garth Brooks a Republican or Democrat?</span></a>
