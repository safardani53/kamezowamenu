She filed for divorce just a month later, and believed herself single when she wed Slash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Years later, when Slash and Ferrar were applying for dual citizenship for their son, Cash, they discovered that the divorce paperwork for the Marty marriage had not been properly filed and a final judgment had never been issued.
