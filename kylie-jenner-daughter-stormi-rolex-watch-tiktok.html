She wore it to a birthday party and she didn’t want to wear it anymore.”</p><a title=@kyliejenner href=# rel=nofollow>@kyliejenner</a><p id=content-paragraph-3><a title="♬ Sweet Sunset - Tollan Kim & dulai" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ Sweet Sunset – Tollan Kim & dulai</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kylie looked stunning in a white tank top as she made the “honest” video, going through a beautiful black <strong>Bottega Veneta</strong> handbag. She wore her hair down and straight, and accessorized with delicate white gold earrings and a pair of sunglasses perched above her forehead for the reveal on her purse contents. She also wore several bold rings on her fingers as she rifled through her purse, which she claimed had not been gone through at all prior to the video.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kylie shared that she had a SKIMS hairclip (“always <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>need a hair clip!</a> Always!”), a bottle of<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Kylie Skin</a> hand sanitizer, Kylie and Anastasia lip liners, and a compact of Glow Bombs blush in the pricey handbag. “The blushier the better!” she said as she applied dabs of the pink blush to her already-glowing cheeks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The significance of a kindergartner wearing a $40k Rolex wasn’t lost on Kylie’s 52.6 million followers on TikTok. “Stormi having a Rolex such a slay,” commented a fan, while another wrote, “Stormi casually wearing a Rolex to a bday party,” alongside a crying emoji.&nbsp; Others were concerned about the potential implications of a child wearing such an expensive accessory. “The possible scratches on that Rolex from being tossed around casually KILLS ME,” remarked a follower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Stormi is Kylie’s first child with ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis</strong> <strong>Scott</strong></a>. And the cosmetics mogul isn’t at all unaware of how much luxury her daughter enjoys. “Look what Harrods did for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stormi to go shopping</a>,” she said during a<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> TikTok video</a> in August of 2022. She was at the retailer with her daughter to visit a Kylie Cosmetics display. They appeared to have set up a little shopping display with posh clothing and shoes just for Stormi, as well. “Is this not the craziest? You are a spoiled, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoiled girl</a>,” she said in the video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e49vZqSxnJ6ybrbEp6Weql2Zrrazx62cq2Wjqbyzuchmqaikla16uK3TnJ9mrJmgwbC3jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julian-opie.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Julian Opie net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
