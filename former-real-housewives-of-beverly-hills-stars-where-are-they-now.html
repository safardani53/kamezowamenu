While some <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> stars have been a part of the Bravo hit since season 1 (looking at you,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>), others have exited the series and moved on.</p><p>The sixth installment in the Real Housewives franchise was announced in March 2010 and aired its first season seven months later. At the time, the series starred Kyle, <a href=#><strong>Adrienne Maloof</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kim Richards</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Camille Grammer</strong></a> and <strong>Taylor Armstrong</strong>.</p><p>Over the years, the cast has seen plenty of shake-ups, most notably Vanderpump’s dramatic exit in June 2019. Us Weekly exclusively confirmed at the time that the restaurateur was <a href=#>not returning to the reality series</a> after nine seasons.</p><p>“I made the decision to leave. It was a very difficult year for me, personally and professionally,” she told Us shortly after she skipped the season 9 reunion taping. “I had wonderful things happen this year, opening up TomTom and the cocktail garden in Vegas. The Housewives, it’s just, it’s emotionally too difficult to deal with.”</p><p>Speculation that Vanderpump was exiting the Bravo series began brewing in November 2018 amid rumors that she wasn’t getting along with her costars. When <a href=#><strong>Denise Richards</strong> </a>— who joined the show for season 9 in 2019 — was having trouble with <a href=#><strong>Brandi Glanville</strong></a> and other cast members, Vanderpump showed the actress support.</p><p>“I hear Denise has been <a href=#>having a really rough time</a>, and I always had a great connection with her,” the Dancing With the Stars alum told Entertainment Tonight in August 2020. “We have a lot in common, you know, in terms of having adopted children and [being] a huge dog lover. I mean, I would love to speak to her at some point. I hear that she’s had a really rough time on [the show].”</p><p>Denise’s rep confirmed the next month that <a href=#>she would not be returning to RHOBH</a> for its 11th season amid her messy feud with Glanville, who claimed that the two women hooked up. The Wild Things star, however, <a href=#>repeatedly denied rumors</a> that she cheated on husband <strong>Aaron Phypers</strong>. Before officially stepping away from the show, Denise hinted in an interview with The Washington Post that she was <a href=#>weighing her options</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I actually had so much fun my first season, and I formed genuine friendships. This season was very different,” she said in July 2020. “But I would never say I regret anything. I just roll with the punches.”</p><p>Scroll through for an update on where the women who left the show are now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BbvLO5xKtkq52RoXqpu9SsnLChpprAbrvFZpmerpWnubp5x6KjpatdqMGivtJmrqGdopp6or7EZquhnaliu7DDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruna-carolina-duarte-ir5e-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bruna Carolina Duarte (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
