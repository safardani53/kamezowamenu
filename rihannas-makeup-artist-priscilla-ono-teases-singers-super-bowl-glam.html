I’m around for all of the creative processes because it gets my wheels turning, and it helps me to start thinking about the look. I’m watching the rehearsals. I’m looking at the lighting. I’m peaking at the wardrobe.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The beauty guru continued: “The glam has always been the finishing touch.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Rihannas-Makeup-Artist-Teases-Super-Bowl-Glam-635.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ono explained that during the last week of rehearsals she pitched “ideas for makeup and even for hair.” She shared that Rihanna is actively involved in the glam process as the “Umbrella” artist, 34, is “very into what her makeup looks like with her hair.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“It’s really fun to experience and be able to prepare for something like this. I’m really proud of her. I feel like a proud mom,” Ono told Us.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The California native has been by Rihanna’s side for many of her big moments, including her appearance at the <a href=#>80th Golden Globes</a> last month. She’s also worked with <a href=#><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Latto,</strong></a> <a href=#><strong>Megan Thee Stallion</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Normani</strong></a>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“The number one thing I do before major performances and red carpet moments is make sure my clients’ skin is healthy … It’s a lot of skin prep, exfoliating and moisturizing,” Ono said, adding: “That’s the key to having long-lasting makeup.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In terms of products, the makeup expert swears by an effective primer and setting spray. “Good primers are going to help your makeup stay on as well as good setting spray. It’s especially good when [Rihanna] or my other clients are performing.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ono also encouraged Us to use more “powder.” She explained: “Powder is going to blur and soften, taking away oil and shine.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Like Rihanna, Ono is also in the midst of a career milestone, celebrating a new partnership with Secret Deodorant.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“This is such a full circle moment,” Ono told Us. “I’ve actually been using <a href=#>Secret Deodorant</a> since I first started wearing deodorant. I remember growing up with my grandma, who is first generation Mexican, and when I was about 12 years old, she used to put a stick of Secret Deodorant in my backpack and that is such a core memory for me.” She continued: “She instilled this kind of being prepared for anything mentality and even when I pack my makeup kits today, I always make sure to bring my Secret Deodorant.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’m especially loving the <a href=#>Weightless Dry Spray in White Peach</a>. I can whip it out at any time. I can pass it to my assistants or anyone who needs it since we often times work such long days and it’s very easy to apply,” Ono shared.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She added: “I’m just really proud of this moment. Any moment that I can tie back to my childhood and my upbringing moves me. A couple of days ago, I went to my grandparents’ house and I told her I was working with Secret and my grandmother was like, ‘Really? Remember when I used to get that for you,’ and I told her that’s the same story I tell everyone. I just love that this ties back to my roots. It keeps me humble and grounded.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e2qa3Np5isZZ2WuKbBz2aYq6yZqMFuvNGiqpyhnKGubrvNqGStnZGosrR50qKloJ2iqHq0wc%2BeqWaan6y5brPLmqRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lena-dunham-issues-formal-apology-to-odell-beckham-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Lena Dunham Issues Formal Apology to Odell Beckham Jr.</span></a>
