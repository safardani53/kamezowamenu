A lot of times when I’m on my social media, I ‘like’ all the fans’ comments,” the 45-year-old model told Us. “I just kind of go down and heart everything and I didn’t even read that comment. I didn’t even know I ‘liked’ it until the press picked it up and it was all over the place. It was just kind of an unfortunate event, but I definitely wasn’t trying to start a social media war!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shanna-Moakler-Reveals-Truth-About-Shady-Comment-She-Liked-About-Kourtney.jpg><p>Moakler, who shares son Landon, 17, and daughter Alabama, 15, with the 45-year-old drummer,<a href=#> made headlines earlier this month after she double-tapped a remark</a> calling Kardashian, 40, a downgrade for Barker. The former Playboy Playmate <a href=#>also raised eyebrows</a> for sharing a post that read, “Stop complaining about your life. There are people out there dating your ex” via Instagram.</p><p>“It was actually about a different ex. It wasn’t about Travis and Kourtney at all,” Moakler told Us. “But to me,​​​​ still, the whole situation, I was trying to just make light of it on my social media. Really at the end of the day, I haven’t been with my ex-husband in over a decade. I have a boyfriend that I’m super happy with and I’m happy he found a girlfriend and a friend. He deserves to be happy as well. I want nothing but the best for him and my kids — that’s the most important thing for me.”</p><p>She added: “My social media is something that I just have fun with. It’s supposed to be fun. It’s not a place where I’m trying to attack anybody.”</p><p>Us confirmed last month that Kardashian, 41, and Barker had been <a href=#>secretly seeing each other “for a couple of months.”</a> The twosome were friends before their relationship turned romantic and according to a source, <a href=#>their children helped bring them together.</a> (The Poosh founder shares Mason, 11, Penelope, 8, and Reign, 6, with ex <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>.)</p><p>“Kourtney and Travis are officially a couple,” the insider told Us on January 24. “Travis is very smitten with Kourtney and has been for a while.”</p><p>After celebrating Valentine’s Day together, the pair made their relationship Instagram official on February 16.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They have big modern families [and they] both are dedicated to their kids. They come from these modern families with modern relationships,” a second source told Us. “Both of their families are supportive. It’s still very new, but they are both very excited by how easy it all has been.”</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGju6J5zKiYpKSVp3qwuoycpqallaPBbr%2FHnmSloZuasW6twaisrWWbpMKzwM2esGajkaexor%2FHopinZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bethenny-frankel-naked-film-rhony-recap.html><span>←</span><span>RHONY's Bethenny Frankel Speaks Out About Naked Film Past: I Don't Regret It</span></a>
