Similarly, we uncovered that Nix’s father was a football coach at the school and college level.</p><p>So, it answers the question of where her love for sports stems from. On the other hand, Wendi seems to be the only child in her family, and maybe that is why Wayne didn’t shy away from immersing his daughter in sports.</p><p>Moreover, it is well-known that Nix was an active cheerleader and a member of the track and field team.</p><p>Wendi would soak in everything she could about sports, and nothing ever really grabbed her attention as football and basketball did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wendi-1310.jpg><p>The South Carolinian went to Socastee High School and then attended Union County College. While there, Wendi pursued a degree in Sports Broadcasting.</p><p>In 1996, Nix graduated from Union with flying colors and subsequently joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After getting accepted into one of the most prestigious institutions, she acquired a degree in Sports Management.</p><p>On the other hand, Wendi didn’t give up on her educational pursuit and attended Wofford College after that. Her affinity towards athletics didn’t fade, as she was an irreplaceable part of the college golf team and even served as the student body president.</p><p>Similarly, Wendi went on to graduate in French and Economics and moved to land a job in broadcasting right after.</p><h2>Wendi Nix | Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>Born in 1974 makes the spectacular sportscaster is 49&nbsp;years old at present.</p><p>24&nbsp;years of service as a broadcaster did not weigh her down as she still serves as a studio host, covering mostly NFL-related&nbsp;news.</p><p>Added to that, her star sign is Virgo, and she is of white ethnicity.</p><p>Wendi is a lady with towering height, not as much as her male co-hosts but definitely compared to her female co-hosts. As such, she stands at the height of 1.78 m.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wendi-1307.jpg><p>Similarly, Nix weighs approximately 139 lbs and maintains her weight and body figure due to her position as a studio host.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, Wendi is undoubtedly the most attractive anchor working today. Nix oozes perfection with a beauty that captivated millions of audiences and blonde wavy hair with striking blue eyes.</p><h2>Wendi Nix | Career As A Sportscaster</h2><p>It only fits for Wendi to pursue a career related to sports as she is a devoted sports geek.</p><p>Coming from a family of football lovers, the South Carolinians entered the sports journalism industry as a reporter for WPDE in 1999.</p><p>Thereafter, with two years of valuable experience, Nix tested her potential with NESN in 2001. Like previous employment, the sportscaster decided to switch in favor of FSN New England&nbsp;a year later.</p><p></p><p>Although Wendi only remained there for a year, the connections made there helped her transition to WHDH, located in Boston, in 2003. Proving her worth at the Boston-based network allowed her more years with them.</p><p>Setting aside her three years at WHDH, Nix discovered a new challenge by working with ESPN, an opportunity the South Carolinians wouldn’t let pass.</p><p>From 2006 to the present date, the blonde reporter actively works as an analyst for the global network.</p><p>Most importantly, Wendi used to co-host NFL Live and was an integral part of the discussion team, and later the role was shifted to <a href=# rel=noopener>Laura Rutledge</a>.</p><p>Being of a sporting background has undeniably helped her break down bits concerning tactics, player stats, and personnel situations.</p><p>In the meantime, Nix went on to display her charisma by covering college football games in New England.</p><p>Moreover, a highlight of her career was marked when, in 2009, the reporter had the honor to be the first woman as the master of ceremonies at the Walter Camp Football Foundation All-America Awards dinner.</p><p>In the viewers’ guide to the NFL weekend edition of September 2022, Wendi appeared in the ESPN NFL Rewind mid-day program.&nbsp;</p><p>It featured analyst Jeff Saturday and Damien Woody, along with host Wendi Nix. They provide fans with analysis and recaps of Sunday’s games and previews of Monday Night Football.</p><h2>Wendi Nix Net Worth | Salary & Income</h2><p>As of later, Wendi amassed an estimated net worth of <strong>$2 million</strong> in her long span of service as an in-studio host. Further, ESPN has a history of paying its employees a somewhat sizeable package, which confirms it.</p><p>Additionally, the NFL Live host earns a salary of around <strong>$800k</strong> yearly. Even though she is a popular broadcaster, nothing has slipped regarding her financial details other than this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Wendi-Nix.jpg><p>Nonetheless, Wendi is an employee of a vast network, and hence we can assume that her financial background is robust.</p><p>Moving on, Nix was once married to Pittsburgh Pirates, General Manager Ben Cherington.</p><p>Reportedly, Ben has a massive net worth amounting to <b>$1 to $10 million</b></p><p>Although Wendi wasn’t in it for money, it indeed stabilized her lifestyle, not that it’s worse at present.</p><p>Besides, sources claim that Cherington paid a hefty sum as part of the divorce settlement and even supports his ex-wife with child support.</p><h2>Wendi Nix Relationship Status | Husband & Kids</h2><p>To begin with, Nix used to be married to Ben Cherington. A life with such a famous personality brought much attention to Wendi and her career as a whole.</p><p>She started dating Ben when she was still studying at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.</p><p>In like manner, she shares two daughters with Ben, whose details remain in the dark for the time being.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wendi-nix-and-her-former-husband-ben-cherington.jpg><p>However, the relationship didn’t last long, and due to mutual differences, the couple thought it to be best to lead separate lives.</p><p>After a divorce in 2010, their daughters moved in with Wendi, whereas Ben comes by to check in from time to time.</p><p>Eventually, Wendi found love again with Joe Ritchie. As mysterious as Wendi’s personal life is, her present husband is a more excellent mystery.</p><p>In particular, Ritchie is an Options and Commodities trader, and aside from this, not much has been revealed to the public.</p><p>Initially, their relationship was revealed through a picture of her on Twitter.</p><p>It was a typical picture alongside Dan Hicks, Trista Sutter, and the family. Additionally, it had a mysterious guy included, and when fans asked who he was, Wendi stated him to be her husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet again, she had been dropping hints about her husband all over Twitter.</p><p>Wendi has not confirmed herself, but Wikipedia has already mentioned Joe Ritchie as her spouse since 2011.</p><p>Joe is an options and commodities trader, international businessman, presidential advisor, and serial entrepreneur.</p><h2>Wendi Nix | Social Media Presence</h2><ul><li>Twitter: 37.6k followers</li></ul><p>Wendi tweeted about Joe Ritchie with her two daughters, captioning it her ‘girls’ dad’.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>He’s my girls’ Dad!
