It was virtually the end-all-be-all when it came to social media platforms — until <a href=#>Zuckerberg</a> came along with Facebook.</p><p>So whatever happened to Tom from Myspace?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's what happened to Tom from Myspace: He made a killing off of the website's sale.</h2><p>Tom sold Myspace in 2005 for a whopping $580 million. Not all of that money went to him, but he still helped broker the massive deal. The man who popularized social media and effectively started Facebook before Facebook has been enjoying a fantasy retirement ever since closing the sale.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/MFRVWxdpk/200x200/mustafa-gatollari-1653400847196.jpg><p>He's known to be a total globe-trotter, traveling to different hot spots and music festivals (he became hooked on photography after attending Burning Man in 2011), and is generally enjoying the millions that he made. He resides in a $3.8 million home in West Hollywood that used to belong to Drew Taggart from the Chainsmokers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened with MySpace after Tom sold it?</h2><p>In 2005, Tom brokered a deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to sell Myspace for a whopping $580 million, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>. Tom and his co-founder Chris DeWolfe got some fat paychecks from the sale. While Myspace would go on to become utterly obsolete in just a few years, News Corp. would sell it to Viant for $35 million, who would then go on to sell it to Time for an amount that wasn't disclosed.</p><p>Yikes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom Anderson's net worth is pretty darn impressive.</h2><p>As of this writing, the man owns a sizable amount of wealth: $60 million, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a>. He is currently an investor in both SpaceX and CRISPR.</p><p>From the looks of his IG account, it appears that a lot of his time since selling MySpace has been spent on capturing utterly breathtaking images and videos while he surfs and travels the globe. However, he has not shared any travel posts since 2018.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"MySpace Tom" became a social media hero after responding to a 2020 tweet about Facebook with just three emojis.</h2><p>In the summer of 2020, Tom went viral for showing gratitude for a viral tweet that praised his work, penned by Twitter user @JackDMurphy. They wrote, "Remember Tom? Remember how he just sold his $500m share in myspace and retired so he could have a nice life? He never sold our data, never tried to influence elections, never lobbied against privacy legislations... what a man. Myspace was just too pure for this world."</p><p>Tom, being a man of few words, simply <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> with three emojis.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Years ago, when there was a ton of hate lobbied at Facebook for the way it handled user data, Tom had some laughs at Zuckerberg's platform's expense when Futurism <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> a funny cartoon about the Myspace co-founder being "our only hope" when it came to a safe social media site. Tom had reportedly retweeted it.</p><p>Even though he doesn't have skin in the social media game anymore, Tom has always been there to remind us who did it first (and did it best).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In late 2022, Tom seemed to be pining for Elon Musk's job at Twitter.</h2><p>Tom may have removed himself from the social media game some years ago, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't consider returning. Case in point: When users voted Elon Musk out of the role of Twitter's CEO via his own poll on the platform, Elon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> by saying, "I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams."</p><p>Tom <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> by saying, "Depends who you get to run it!"</p><p>The former MySpace head <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to Elon's tweet once again after that with a screenshot of his MySpace profile, indicating he would take on the CEO job.</p><p>It appears as though his comment wasn't a dig toward Elon at all. In fact, Tom <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> in 2021 that he is a proud investor in Elon's other company: SpaceX.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In late 2023, a Myspace documentary was announced.</h2><p>In October 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reported that Tom and Chris — along with "many of the original Myspace crew, as well as a slew of notable stars who got their start on the platform," per the outlet — would be featured in a documentary about Myspace that was in the works.</p><p>Director Tommy Avallone said, per Deadline: "I remember being on Myspace in the beginning. In fact, Myspace is where I first started talking to my now-wife."</p><p>"It was an amazing time — before our phones took over our lives, the internet was fun, not a responsibility," he added. "Myspace was a party you could only join by sitting at a computer and I’m very excited to tell the origin story of who we have become through social media. I’ve already put together my Myspace playlist of bangers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStp51is7O7zGaksquglrCm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scarlett-johansson-and-bradley-cooper-new-couple-alert.html><span>←</span><span>Scarlett Johansson &amp;amp; Bradley Cooper: New Couple Alert?</span></a>
