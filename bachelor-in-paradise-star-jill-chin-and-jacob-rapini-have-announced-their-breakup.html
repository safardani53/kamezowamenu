<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Bachelor in Paradise Star Jill Chin And Jacob Rapini Have Announced Their Breakup</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Jill Chin and Jacob Rapini</strong>, another Bachelor in Paradise pair, have called it quits. Jill co-hosted the Click Bait with Bachelor Nation podcast with Joe Amabile and Natasha Parker on Thursday, December 1, 2022. She explained that she had broken up with Jacob after their brief relationship after the reconnection.&nbsp;Jill and Jacob clicked on their one-on-one date on season 8 of Bachelor in Paradise. The ex-couple was doing well until the Split Week surprise when Jacob struck up a friendship with newbie Kate Gallivan while Jill was gone.</p><p>Jill and Jacob split up shortly after, but they reunited during the reunion, giving their love a second shot. Jill talked out about the break-up to her other podcast co-hosts and said:</p><p>“What about the relationship?” Some may argue that the launch was a failure. Unfortunately, it did get it to the hard launch phase, but it quickly terminated.”</p><h2>“The trust had been damaged,” says Jill of her separation from Jacob on Bachelor in Paradise.</h2><p>Jill and Jacob returned to the beach for a second chance at love on Bachelor in Paradise season 8. Despite their appearance in Week 1, the couple didn’t get together until episode 5 of the competition, when Jill opted to go on a date with Jacob. The former pair met on one of the most unusual dates on the program and stayed together until a huge twist messed up their relationship.&nbsp;Jesse Palmer, the show’s host, unveiled the Split Week twist, in which the original girls had to leave the beach and remain in the hotel, while their connections had to meet a new batch of women and put their relationships to the test. While Jill and the other ladies were gone, they were met by a fresh group of males.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jill-Chin-1.jpg alt="Jill Chin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The twist created a lot of drama since a number of relationships were put to the test, with some succeeding and others failing. Jill and Jacob belonged to the latter group since Jacob linked with newcomer Kate Gallivan while Jill struggled to be apart from him. When she returned, Jacob ended their relationship, claiming that he had a better connection with the real estate agent.&nbsp;Jill and Jacob reunited in November 2022 and decided to give their love another go after the latter made a big gesture on the Bachelor in Paradise reunion program.</p><p>During the episode’s broadcast, both shared photographs and messages on their own social media accounts, admitting that they were giving each other a chance, driving fans into a frenzy. However, Jill stated on the Click Bait podcast the following month that the relationship had terminated. Jill explained that she had no option except to break the trust. The reality star also stated that the couple had planned a vacation to Rhode Island, but “then sadly everything sort of fell through.”</p><p>Jill stated:</p><p>“There was absolutely no other option.” I had no choice but to do what was best for me. And there’s simply a boundary and standards you have for yourself that you can’t let others cross.”</p><p>The Bachelor in Paradise star went on to emphasize the importance of trust in a relationship, saying:</p><p>“I have no ill will.” I don’t make negative predictions. The trust had been shattered. And that in a long-distance relationship, communication and trust are essential, and we lacked both.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jill-Chin-2.jpg alt="Jill Chin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jill also said that, despite the fact that the pair had split up, she did not wish anything evil on Jacob. She stated:</p><p>“I don’t wish Jacob ill will. I believe that if he puts in some effort, he may be a nice companion to someone in the future. Hopefully, he will, and someone will be suitable for him.”</p><p>While a few couples made it to the end of Bachelor in Paradise, got engaged, or left the island as a pair, fans also watched a lot of breakups. While some stayed friendly, others generated a lot of turmoil that lasted long after the reunion program aired.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZmpuYmrmwvoyipWaokaeupbXSnmSsrJGnequ1y6VknKCZo3qiusNmoZqbn5d6s63PoqWiZZiWw6Z5wKelqK2emLKledOhnKKqXZe%2Fpq3Krqdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-rodgers-shailene-woodleys-maui-getaway-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Aaron Rodgers, Shailene Woodleys Maui Getaway: Photos</span></a>
