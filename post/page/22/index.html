THOSE who tuned into Help! We Bought A Village were all saying the same thing about the colossal project.
Paul Mappley and Yip Ward, both 48, were living in a mobile home in&nbsp;Tunbridge Wells, Kent,&nbsp;when they decided to make a huge leap and purchase a home abroad.
The couple decided to buy hamlet&nbsp;La Busliere, in Normandy, France, and their journey is being documented by Channel 4.

Everyone loves Fran Drescher! The 90’s TV icon became a household name after her CBS sitcom, ‘The Nanny, delighted audiences for six seasons and you can see her best photos here.
Following the quirky shennagins of a lovable but goofy working stiff from Flushing, Queens who lands the posh job of taking care of 3 kids in Manhattan, the show’s instant success meant great things for Fran from there on out.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Serena Williams Shows Unretouched Body, Talks US Open 2018 Loss</h2><time>Sep 2, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../serena-williams-shows-unretouched-body-talks-us-open-2018-loss.html></a>
At this point, it’s basically indisputable: Serena Williams is the greatest tennis player of all time. With 23 grand slam singles titles under her belt — just one shy of the most ever in women’s tennis — you’d be forgiven for thinking she’s going to win every tournament she enters.
Of course, it’s impossible to win every championship. At the 2018 U.S. Open title game, Williams’ ardent fans watched as she was penalized three times in the final moments of the final set for speaking out to the umpire — and ultimately lost to Japan’s Naomi Osaka.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Actually Published by New York Post!</h2><time>Sep 1, 2024</time>

Over the course of his Presidential campaign, Donald Trump has insulted Mexicans.
And Muslims.&nbsp;
And women.
And pretty much anyone who isn’t Donald Trump.&nbsp;
He even went after Khizr Khan over this weekend, following the moving speech that "Patriotic Muslim" gave about his dead soldier of a son at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Here's What Led to the End of Vine!</h2><time>Sep 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../what-happened-to-vine.html></a>
Vine was once one of the most popular video sharing applications around. However, the app has since been shut down and some people can't get over it.
By D.M.Aug. 1 2023, Published 9:39 p.m. ET
Long before the era of TikTok, Vine was the go-to app for video content. In 2012, Colin Kroll, Rus Yusupovand, and Dom Hofmann developed the video sharing platform which allowed users to record and post six-second video clips online.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez Reacted to Grammys Memes</h2><time>Sep 1, 2024</time>

On the same page? Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez aren’t stressing over the Argo actor’s Grammys faces being made into memes, a source exclusively reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly.
“Ben wanted to stay at the Grammys while Jennifer had planned to come, present, leave as they had a dinner that evening,” an insider says of the couple’s plans for the 2023 awards show.

Eric & Sookie finally&nbsp;consummated&nbsp;their timeless romance, while Bill drowned his sorrows in a glass of wine. Did I mention he was alone?
I’ve been looking forward to the July 31 episode of True Blood — the much-hyped full moon episode — for a while now, and I have to be honest, it was a little disappointing. As it turns out, you can’t “make” someone a were-panther, so Jason (Ryan Kwanten) didn’t get his big transformation, despite the many episodes dedicated to building up his story line.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Stream live TV, Movies, Originals, News, and more</h2><time>Sep 1, 2024</time>
