The reality TV personalities are partnering with the home security brand to offer a home makeover and professionally installed ADT smart security system to the lucky winners, because everyone deserves a “beautiful, safe home.”</p><p>Jonathan and the New Girl alum, 40, have only been <a href=#>dating since September 2019</a>, but the home improvement expert is going all out for the special day.</p><p>“The unfortunate thing for me is I’m starting two new demolition projects in Vegas, so I can’t leave town [on Valentine’s Day],” Jonathan told Us. “But in Vegas I’ve prepped an entire evening of romance, so we’re going to be doing a full romantic everything: from the meal to a surprise evening event … It’s going to be pretty fun.”</p><p>The Brother vs. Brother star met Deschanel on the set of Carpool Karaoke in August and <a href=#>made their relationship Instagram official</a> just two months later after a spooky <a href=#>double date</a> with Drew and his wife, <strong>Linda Phan</strong>, at Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios. A source revealed to Us in the early days of the couple’s relationship that the two “had instant chemistry” when they first met.</p><p>“They’ve bonded over their love of music, film, theatre — and <a href=#>Christmas carols</a>,” the insider said in September 2019.</p><p>One of Jonathan’s favorite things about his relationship, in fact, is just how much he and the (500) Days of Summer star have in common.</p><p>“I’ve never actually been in a relationship where someone <a href=#>reciprocates</a> the amount of romance and the amount of little things that I put into it. We’re into a lot of the same things,” he told Us. “We’ve been doing escape rooms and just spending time together. It’s really great … We’re both vegetarian and finding great restaurants. She’s an incredible cook. We find ourselves most of the time just adventuring through escape rooms and then enjoying amazing cooking.”</p><p>Drew, also 41, isn’t surprised to see his twin’s more <a href=#>romantic side</a> emerge as Valentine’s Day approaches.</p><p>“In our family, between me and my older brother, Jamie, Jonathan has always been a romantic,” Drew told Us. “He actually, when I first started dating Linda, Jonathan was giving me a little hints on things I could do here and there.”</p><p>News of Jonathan’s whirlwind romance with Deschanel came shortly after Us confirmed in September 2019 that the <a href=#>She & Him</a> singer had split from husband <a href=#><strong>Jacob Pechenik</strong></a>, with whom she shares daughter Elsie Otter, 4, and son Charlie Wolf, 2. The film producer, 47, officially <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in Los Angeles six weeks later, citing their date of separation as January 8, 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Deschanel has hit a number of relationship milestones with the HGTV star as their relationship heated up, including their first <a href=#>Thanksgiving</a> and <a href=#>New Year’s Eve</a> together. Jonathan wished the Elf actress a <a href=#>happy birthday</a> before her fun-filled ’80s-themed party in January, showing love to “the beautiful human who brought joy & laughter back into my life.”</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp56WwamtzWaqnKekqXqprdJmmaKfXaW5orrSZp2oql2vvLCx2GabnquTna6vsctmpqdlppa5prrToqWeq12Zrrp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frank-g-jackson.html><span>←</span><span>Frank G.
