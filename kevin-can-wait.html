His kids, Sara, Jack and Kendra, are grateful to him for making sure they're okay but decide it's time for him to get out of the house, so they turn to Vanessa, his former police partner, for help. Vanessa has left the force to launch her own private security firm, and she makes Kevin an offer he can't refuse – to be her new business partner. Although the job isn't always glamorous and they rarely see eye to eye, Kevin and Vanessa share an undeniable bond from their years working together. Also, Kendra and her fiancé, Chale, face issues of their own, including becoming newlyweds and figuring out how they will support themselves. Once again, life has thrown Kevin some curveballs, so his dreams of an early retirement will just have to wait a little longer, and his family will always come first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9Joop6umaN6pK3NZq6aoaRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tesco-delivery-driver-loves-job-paid-listen-sport.html><span>←</span><span>Im a Tesco delivery driver and my jobs the best - Im basically paid to listen to sport all</span></a>
