As <a href=#>the show’s popularity continued to grow</a> alongside Miley’s own musical ambitions, she was tapped for the cover of <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Famed fashion photographer Leibowitz, now 73, was slated to take the portraits of the 15-year-old. The images quickly drew backlash over the decision to <a href=#>allow a teenage star to pose topless</a>, wrapped only in a white bedsheet.</p><p class=p1>Disney Channel even called out the magazine in a statement for “deliberately” manipulating Miley — one of the daughters of now-exes <a href=#><strong>Billy Ray Cyrus</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tish Cyrus</strong> </a>— “in order to sell magazines.”</p><p class=p1>Miley, for her part, swiftly issued an apology and noted that the pictures were “supposed to be ‘artistic’” but since felt “so embarrassed.”</p><p class=p1>“I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about,” she concluded her statement at the time.</p><p class=p1>A spokesperson for<i> Vanity Fair</i> defended the photo shoot, claiming that either Miley’s parents or set “minders” were around the set “all day.” In a statement to<a href=#><i> The New York Times</i></a>, the rep explained: “Since the photo was taken digitally, they saw it on the shoot and everyone thought it was a beautiful and natural portrait of Miley,” the rep told the newspaper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Miley-Cyrus-Says-It-Was-Meaningful-That-Sister-Noah-Cyrus-Took-Infamous-Vanity-Fair-Photo2.jpg><p class=p1>Nearly one decade later, Miley recanted her apology. “IM NOT SORRY,” she wrote via her Instagram Story in April 2018. “F*/k YOU #10YearsAgo.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Miley — who wrapped <i>Hannah Montana</i> in January 2011 — <a href=#>further noted on Wednesday</a> that this shoot was the first time that <a href=#>she was seen as completely separate</a> from her on-camera persona.</p><p class=p1>“This image of me is the complete opposite of the bubblegum pop star that I had been known for being, and that’s what was so upsetting,” Miley concluded her video. “But really brilliant choices looking back now from those people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZyaxm6v2KusrGWjlsa0ec2omKFlk66%2Ftr%2BMraaoo12rrq%2B107Jkn5mZp3q1u8%2BlnKyrXaW1sMDOaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rymma-zyubina.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Rymma Zyubina net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
