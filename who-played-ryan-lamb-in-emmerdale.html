his half-brother Nathan made sure she knew all about his relationship wit Maisie, thus forcing him to move back in with his mother.</p><p>Tensions quickly began to arise between both brothers as Ryan was Mark Wylde's eldest legitimate son, making him the rightful heir to his fortune, which included his money and property.</p><p>Nathan was jealous and felt threatened by Ryan but things only got worse when Mark was murdered by his second wife Natasha Wylde following the revelation of his bigamy.</p><p>Mark's body was found by Sam Dingle (<a href=#>James Hooton</a>) in July, 2010, and Ryan was arrested.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Nathan didn't make things any easier for him as he framed Ryan by burying the murder weapon at the garage, putting gunpowder residue on his clothes and planting a gold chain of his at the crime scene.</p><p>While behind bars, Ryan embarked on a relationship with prison guard Abi Peterson but Nathan went above and beyond to sabotage him and she was soon moved to another prison.</p><p>It dawned on Ryan that Nathan was the only one capable of framing him for the murder of Mark Wylde and stealing the evidence capable of proving his innocence.</p><p>As Maisie was fighting to get Ryan out of prison, Nathan goaded him during a prison visit, making a veiled threat to his mother Faye's life.</p><p>In late 2010, however, both Cain Dingle (<a href=#>Jeff Hordley</a>) and Maisie managed to intimidate Nathan into telling the truth and he revealed that Natasha had killed Mark herself.</p><p>Natasha confessed to the authorities, leading to Ryan being released from prison and returning to the village.</p><p>Conflict was in the air once Ryan came back to Emmerdale as he was adamant on making Nathan pay for his actions.</p><p>After multiple altercations, Nathan was finally tricked into confessing his involvement in Ryan's unfair imprisonment, just as the rest of his family were getting ready to leave the Dales.</p><p>With the help of businessman Declan Macey, Ryan was able to record Nathan admitting what he had done and told Maisie and Will all about his confession.</p><p>The recorded admission was then used against Nathan as Ryan threatened him into staying away from both Maisie and Will.</p><p>This prompted Nathan to leave Emmerdale the same day.</p><p>Maisie and Will also moved away to Dartford after the former's failed engagement with Nikhil Sharma and Ryan bid them farewell.</p><p>In March, 2011, Faye followed suit and left the village for San Francisco when she lost her job.</p><p>Although she offered him the chance to leave with her, Ryan refused, stating that his future was in Emmerdale.</p><p>But he soon changed his mind after Cain began to involve him in his criminal schemes.</p><p>Ryan assessed his life in the village, deciding to leave for a fresh start despite Debbie's pleas for him to stay.</p><p>Motivated by the fact he had no girlfriend of family members holding him back, Ryan got ready to leave Emmerdale in April, 2011.</p><p>Ryan packed his car after making peace with Cain and Andy Sugden, Katie and Gennie Walker all came to bid him farewell.</p><p>Katie Sugden was the last villager to beg him to change his mind but Ryan stood his ground.</p><p>He was last seen promising to keep in touch and nodding his remaining friends farewell while driving out of the village.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">EMMERDALE NEWS</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/emmerdale_pubjpg-JS643808988.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Everything you need to know about Emmerdale</p><h2>Who played Ryan Lamb in Emmerdale?</h2><p>Throughout his stay in the Dales, Ryan Lamb was portrayed by actor <a href=#>James Sutton</a>.</p><p>Born James Cook in Birmingham, 40-year-old James studied at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff.</p><p>James began his acting career in 2006 with the role of Barry Milne in the ITV police drama Trial & Retribution.</p><p>That same year, James got his big break in the <a href=#>Channel 4</a> soap opera <a href=#>Hollyoaks</a> as John Paul McQueen, a role he has remained committed to ever since.</p><p>James joined the Emmerdale line-up during a break from the Chester-based show and also made a brief appearance in the <a href=#>BBC One</a> medical drama <a href=#>Casualty</a>.</p><p>He eventually returned to Hollyoaks in 2012 before leaving the role again in 2017 and coming back on a permanent basis in 2019.</p><p>In 2012, the TV star appeared in a string of dramas including Scott & Bailey, <a href=#>Holby City</a> and Bedlam.</p><p>He was also called to take part in the Hollyoaks 2020 spin-off Hollyoaks Later.</p><p>While he's mostly known for his roles on the box, James also played in Ian Salmon's play Venus Rising at the Hope Street Theatre in Liverpool in 2018 after meeting the playwright through The Anfield Wrap -
