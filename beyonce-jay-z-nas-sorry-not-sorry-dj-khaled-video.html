While Beyoncé didn’t appear in the song’s accompanying music video, the video does address her surprising cameo: once she sings “Hey,” Jay-Z looks behind his shoulder.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Beyonce</a> ‘s little “heyyy” and her background vocals on Sorry Not Sorry are all I needed to get through the rest of the year. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#SorryNotSorry</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@djkhaled</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— Tkani Finau (@TkaniFinau) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 30, 2021</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beyoncé: “Hey”<br>Hive:<br><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/KIbU2cUrem</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— irishˣ⁴🐝GOT S WORDED (@beytnotsicka) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 30, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Long before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pusha T </strong></a>versus <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Drake </strong></a>or <strong>Taylor Swift </strong>versus <strong>Katy Perry </strong>(or Taylor Swift versus <strong>Kanye West</strong>) were the biggest feuds in music, Jay Z and Nas’s rivalry were the definition of beef. The schism began in 1996, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>High Snobiety’</a>s timeline of the feud, after Nas reportedly failed to show up to record verses for Jay’s “Bring It On,” off of Reasonable Doubt. Nas’ second album, It Was Written, starts with “The Message,” which contained the line “Lex with TV sets the minimum,” which was a shot at Hova (who made many references to the luxury brand on Reasonable Doubt.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I saw JAY-Z driving a Lexus with the TVs in them. I got rid of my Lexus at that point, and I was looking for the next best thing. It wasn’t a shot at Jay, but it was just saying that’s the minimum you gotta have,” Nas told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Complex</a>. “It’s not a shot at him but he inspired that line.” Jay seemingly shot back at Nas on “Where I’m From,” rapping, “I’m from where n—– pull your card, and argue all day about/Who’s the best MC’s, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas.” Some would claim that Roc-A-Fella artist/Jay-Z protégé <strong>Memphis Bleek </strong>was brought in to feud with Nas, but things went problematic when Nas dropped the “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stillmatic Freestyle</a>.” Along with the unfortunate homophobic insults, Nas called out the “fake king of New York,” before rapping, “You show off, I count off when you sample my voice / I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens / Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jay-z-nas-dj-khaled-sorry-not-sorry-song-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>The pressure from Nas saw Jay respond with “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Takeover</a>,” first as a freestyle and then as a polished track on 2001’s The Blueprint. “That’s why your (lame!) career’s come to an end / it’s only so long fake thugs can pretend,” rapped Jay on the track. “ So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong / You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song (Woo!).” It was considered a fatal blow – until Nas unleashed “Ether” off his 2001 album, Stillmatic. “I got this, locked since Nine-One (1991), I am the truest/ Name a rapper that I ain’t influenced,” he rapped. Nas would then insinuate that Jay copied his style and sold out. “Y’all n— deal with emotions like bitches/ What’s sad is I love you cause you’re my brother, you traded your soul for riches.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jay Z and Nas on the same track <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/FjnhM7xqwS</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>— Naïm ⛷ 🛸 (@ANG3X6_) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 28, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Most gave the round to Nas, but Jay-Z fired back with “Supa Ugly,” which saw Jay brag about an alleged three-year affair with Nas’ girlfriend at the time, <strong>Carmen Bryan </strong>(Jay bragging about affairs seems odd in the post-Lemonade era, but these were the early 2000s.) Most listeners thought the response was weak, and Jay’s own mother called him and told him to apologize. “Mom put in a call and said, ‘That went too far.’ And she’s never, ever called me about music,” said Jay, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HipHopDX</a>. “So I was like ‘Okay, okay, okay. I’ll go shut it down.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>It got shut down – seemingly for good – in 2005. Jay and Nas buried the hatchet during Power 105.1’s Power House concert, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>. Jay suggested that an earlier reunion between <strong>Diddy </strong>and rapper <strong>Lox/D-Block </strong>had inspired him, and he brought out Nas “to deafening applause.” The two stood next to each other for two minutes of cheers before launching into a fifteen-minute set that included “The World Is Yours,” “Street Dreams,” and more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>So, when are we getting the JAY-Z/Nas Verzuz?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5JpZpudqaS7pLGMo5iyZapiu6K%2FjKymq6qpYruwwIyspquqqWKxq3nKoZilnZRiw6qwxKhm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./asda-disney-christmas-decorations.html><span>←</span><span>ASDA is selling Disney Christmas decorations and they start at just 1.50</span></a>
