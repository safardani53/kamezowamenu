“Something that I’m really proud of is my ability to survive,” Madix, 38, tells Us Weekly on the set of her recent cover story interview.
The Vanderpump Rules personality — a staple since season 2 — made headlines in March after news broke that Tom Sandoval cheated on her with their costar Rachel “Raquel” Leviss. Madix has since cut ties with both her ex-boyfriend and Leviss, 29, as she focused on healing, moving forward, her upcoming Something About Her shop and a new romance with Daniel Wai."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I love all things spooky and scary, and I love the way people decorate.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>My biggest fear is dying — for obvious reasons.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>I was fired once from a job. It was a sports bar on Third Street here in Los Angeles. It’s the only job I’ve ever been fired from and it’s because I didn’t know how to get there. I just moved to L.A. and there was an accident and I only knew one way of getting there and it was before we were just mapping everything on our phones. I had a Blackberry and so I was late and I got fired.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>My first job was actually working in my grandma and my uncle’s real estate office. And I don’t know if it really counts really, but I was doing secretarial-type stuff for my grandma.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>My first car was a 1998 Acura TL. It was, like, a hunter, dark green color and that car could tell some stories [about] typical teenager stuff.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>One thing I won’t eat is octopus because they’re super, super smart and they’re my favorite ocean animal.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>I’ve been to some really, really, really amazing concerts, so it’s really tough to choose a favorite. So, I’m going to go with my most recent and that is <a href=#><strong>Beyonce</strong>‘s <i>Renaissance </i>tour</a> and it was incredible in every way. We were in Club Renaissance. We definitely made eye contact with Beyonce and after that, I was like, ‘I can die happy.’</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>One dish that I will always impress a date with is my mom’s lemon potatoes. Basically, you cut up potatoes [and] you spread them all out on a tray. It’s a lot of just salt, pepper and a ton of fresh lemon juice. You roast them in the oven, they come out, they’re crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. They’re so good.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>Something that I’m really proud of is my ability to survive.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>If someone were to play me in a movie, I want it to be <a href=#><strong>Florence Pugh</strong></a> because I just feel like she could really get me and I think she’s just absolutely incredible.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>If I’m having a bad day and I need to zone out, I will watch 50 episodes of <a href=#><i>Love Island</i></a>.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>My favorite smell is the smell of jasmine. There’s a lot of neighborhoods here in Los Angeles where it’s just growing everywhere and if you take a walk outside, like a mental health walk, you can just smell it all through the neighborhood and it is the best smell.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>My celebrity crush growing up was <a href=#><strong>Taylor Hanson</strong></a> and <a href=#>I did get to meet him</a> and take a picture with him recently and I was dying.</span></li><li class=li2><span class=s1>My biggest turnoff is people who smack when they’re eating. If I am sitting next to a person who is eating and I just hear I am going to die.</span></li><li class=li3><span class=s1>The most daring thing I’ve done recently was go on <a href=#><i>Dancing with the Stars </i></a>and do <a href=#>the hardest dance there is</a> to do, the samba, in my second week on the show.</span></li><p class=p4>For more on Madix, pick up the new issue of <a href=#><span class=s2><i>Us Weekly</i></span></a>, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaprZ2lerPBy56qZpminq6vrYymmJ2hqGK2tHnRnpilpKlivbO71J1kqJ5dnbKzecCboKWhpK56tbuMrKyrrpmrsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./philip-daniel-bolden.html><span>←</span><span>Philip Daniel Bolden</span></a>
