And I hope he agrees. What do you think?”</p><p>She added: “Happy birthday my love!”</p><p>Despite Dolly's superstardom, Carl - who used to own an asphalt business - keeps a much lower profile.</p><p>Here we look at their love story and inside their "open" relationship...</p><h2>Love outside the laundromat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/003d415f-e53e-4bfa-822d-db29509d2316.jpg><p>Dolly has been with Carl Thomas Dean for more than 55 years.</p><p>The pair met outside their local laundromat in Nashville on the first day the singer moved to the famous music city in 1964.&nbsp;</p><p>Dolly was 18 while Carl was 21 at the time.</p><p>“We actually met the first day I moved to Nashville,” Dolly told TV talk show <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Home & Family</a>. “I was 18 years old, 1964.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had taken some dirty clothes in a rush to get to Nashville. I was down at the Wishy Washy laundromat. I had put my clothes in the laundry in this machine and I was all new in Nashville to stay.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was walking around on the street and this good looking guy drove by and he said something to me like ‘Hey, you gonna get sunburned out there,’ or something. I said ‘What’s it to you?’ or something like that.”</p><p>She continued: “He pulled over and we started talking. I was actually babysitting at the time and so we talked. I told him where I was staying. I said ‘Well, you come buy tomorrow and we’ll talk.’&nbsp;</p><p>“So he came by a couple of days, we sat out on the fire escape where I was babysitting the little boy and we had a first date.&nbsp;</p><p>“He took me home to his mama very first time.”</p><p>And it was love at first sight for Carl.</p><p>“My first thought was I’m gonna marry that girl,” he <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said on Dolly's official website</a>, recalling the meeting.</p><p>“My second thought was, ‘Lord she’s good lookin.’ And that was the day my life began.”</p><h2>Desperate to marry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/f626f609-56d9-46a3-94a0-f694ad44ec1a.jpg><p>The couple tied the knot two years later on May 30, 1966 in Ringgold, Georgia, shortly before Dolly released her first album.</p><p>Dolly planned to have a big wedding but it didn’t turn out that way, and her mother was the only witness.</p><p>Her record label wanted her to wait a year before getting married since it was just starting to invest in her career, but Dolly was adamant.</p><p>The couple went across the <a href=#>Tennessee </a>state line and found a little Baptist church where they were married in a small ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>“My mother made me a little white dress, a little bible with a little flowers,” said Dolly. “Brother Don Duvall was the reverend then, he’s passed away now. We go back to Ringgold every year on our anniversary, as a rule.”</p><h2>An 'open' relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/b5e7000d-0134-4330-97e2-ab59b1ccb7fa.jpg><p>Dolly has admitted she and Carl have an "open" relationship - although never in a sexual way.</p><p>And she insists she's never been with anyone else but her husband.</p><p>In Dolly on Dolly, Interviews and Encounters with Dolly Parton, the country star explained: "Men are my weakness.</p><p>"Short, fat, bald or skinny – I’ve had crushes on some very unusual men but Carl knows I’ll always come home and I’m not having sex with these people – I’m just flirting and having fun.</p><p>"He’s not jealous and I’m not jealous of him. He knows I flirt. He flirts too."</p><p>She continued: "Yes, it’s an open relationship, but not sexually and I would kill him if I thought he was doing that.</p><p>"He would shoot me too. At the end of the day we love each other madly."</p><p>In fact, one of Dolly's famous songs, Jolene, was about a woman who flirted outrageously with Carl - and she says he spent a "little too much time" with her so she had to put an end to it.</p><h2>Renewing their vows</h2><p>Dolly eventually got the big wedding she dreamed of in 2016, when the pair marked their 50th wedding anniversary.</p><p>&nbsp;"We're going to get married again!" Dolly gushed to People ahead of their vow renewal.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll have a beautiful wedding dress, 'cause I didn't have a big long wedding dress when we got married, and we've got a suit for him, so we're going to dress up and take a bunch of pictures."</p><h2>Keeping out of the limelight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000469974466.jpg><p>A key to Dolly and Carl’s enduring relationship is that they keep their relationship out of the limelight.</p><p>And Carl - who is now retired - rarely accompanies his wife to events.</p><p>In fact, he’s only ever seen Dolly perform a few times over the years as he “gets nervous” watching her.</p><p>"No, he doesn't like to do that," Dolly told <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>. "He gets nervous seeing me perform.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's almost like seeing your kid in a recital. He's afraid I'll mess up.”</p><p>She continued: “Actually, he has seen me a time or two and it did relax him a little.&nbsp;</p><p>“He saw that I do mess up and it's OK because people are not going to punish me for it."</p><h2>No children and no regrets</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000615599984.jpg><p>Dolly and Carl never had any children - despite the fact that they did both want them.</p><p>In 2014, she confessed: “Early on, when my husband and I were dating, and then when we got married, we just assumed we would have kids.</p><p>“We weren't doing anything to stop it. In fact, we thought maybe we would.&nbsp;</p><p>“We even had names if we did, but it didn't turn out that way.”</p><p>However, she’s now happy she never got the chance to become a mum.</p><p>She added: “Now that Carl and I are older, we often say, ‘Aren't you glad we didn't have kids? Now we don't have kids to worry about.’”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON DOLLY PARTON</h2></p><p>And in 2017, the country singer - who is godmother to <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> - said: “God has a plan for everything. I think it probably was his plan for me not to have kids so everybody's kids could be mine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“And they are now.”</p><p>What a lovely relationship Dolly and Carl have...</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Dolly Parton, 75, dresses up like a Playboy bunny for husband Carl's birthday 43 years after her original magazine cover</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrY2d%2BeYGYaJuopJyuerGt0a2mp2Wdlr%2BztcCgnGabkae5brDEmqVmoKWor6K6w2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-baby-father-kaleidoscope.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is the Father of Hannah's Baby in 'Kaleidoscope'?</span></a>
