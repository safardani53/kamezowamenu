Fortunately, pimple patches are an easy and effective way to remove bacteria and heal acne.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skincare professionals agree that pimple patches are a great solution to healing acne. Dr. Rachel Nazarian, dermatologist and faculty member at Mount Sinai Medical Center’s Department of Dermatology, is a pimple-patch enthusiast. “I love them — I’m a huge fan,” Dr. Nazarian tells PEOPLE. “They really help address several different issues when it comes to acne and pimples. The patch allows you to feel like you’re being proactive about taking care of that spot that is driving you bananas without using your fingers and damaging the area.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many pimple patches are formulated with a hydrocolloid barrier. “Historically, hydrocolloid has been used for wound care, and it works similarly for acne, which is kind of a 'wound' on the skin,” shares Dr. Nazarian.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We researched the best pimple patches for various acne types and considered ease of use, sticking power, coverage, and effectiveness. Our top pick, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Peace Out's Salicylic Acid Acne Healing Dots</a>, helps clear acne and calm inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the best pimple patches currently on the market.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-peace-out-salicylic-acid-acne-healing-dots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Peace Out Acne Dots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Peace Out Salicylic Acid Acne Healing Dots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/E2r3Hh72GUN_AGry2kQbpGwl8Rs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peace-out-salicylic-acid-acne-healing-dots-eb57ff6fad9746b381f85754d405e285.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>These are for anyone who needs patches for visible whiteheads because they include effective ingredients like salicylic acid, aloe vera, and retinol.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whiteheads are no match for the Peace Out Salicylic Acne Healing Dots. These little gunk-suckers are powered by salicylic acid to penetrate pimples and a hydrocolloid barrier to adsorb all the nasty stuff. These polymer disks go above and beyond with the addition of calming aloe vera leaf extract to reduce visually irritated marks and vitamin A (aka retinol) to prevent future ones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These patches are uber sticky, not at all irritating, and form a protective barrier against environmental stressors that can inflame spots — including your pesky fingers. Salicylic acid is not the irritating ingredient you might think it is and can help calm red, angry acne, explains Dr. Nazarian. “Salicylic acid is one of the more gentle ingredients when it comes to treating acne,” says Dr. Nazarian. “It does help slough the skin, it has what we call a 'keratolytic effect,' so it breaks up the dead skin cells and the keratin. It’s kind of a classic ingredient that’s used in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>acne treatment</a>.” Of course, if you have a sensitivity to salicylic acid or retinol, you'll want to steer clear of these patches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What sets these patches apart from the pack is their unmatched sticking power that grips onto the skin and won’t flake off while you doze. The effective ingredients stored in each little patch help to visually minimize painful bumps overnight but are most effective on spots with whiteheads.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Patches Included: </strong>20 | <strong>Type:</strong> Hydrocolloid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cruelty-free-hero-cosmetics-mighty-patch-the-original-72-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cruelty-Free</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mighty Patch Original from Hero Cosmetics" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/E45Q-R2ZXSyFGVp9M35g9q5sMm8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Mighty-Patch-Original-from-Hero-Cosmetics-3bcd9f0da9674e4c8cbf3e2559fc2f29.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What could be more satisfying than peeling off a pimple sticker covered in all the goo it removed from a blemish? If you’re also a sucker for that gross yet gratifying feeling, we think you’ll love the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch as much as we do. The original Mighty Patch is made with medical-grade hydrocolloid, a gel used to absorb and trap oil and bacteria without damaging the skin — hydrocolloid is often used in bandages to absorb discharge from wounds. These patches are also cruelty-free, chemical-free, allergy-tested, and vegan-friendly, so you can feel confident using them on sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These little disks work wonders on pimples with visible whiteheads but miss the mark on cystic acne, those painful, deep-in-the-skin acne marks that haven’t yet poked above the skin’s surface.&nbsp;These patches aren't invisible, so let them do their work overnight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Patches Included: </strong>72 | <strong>Type:</strong> Hydrocolloid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-korean-beauty-cosrx-acne-pimple-master-patch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Korean Beauty</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=cosrx-acne-pimple-master-patch-at-amazon style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LCjZiv-mQ7CKftgdCyg2JopLSCw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cosrx-acne-pimple-master-patch-at-amazon-63fbbc6dd70a477ab62d6faeda208eea.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With more than 24,100 five-star reviews, these patches from K-beauty experts Cosrx are a certified classic. Inside the resealable pack comes 96 circular hydrocolloid patches in three different sizes: small (7mm), medium (10mm), and large (12mm). Keep in mind that they're not invisible, and some shoppers with sensitive skin noticed small red marks under the patches upon removal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Patches Included: </strong>96 | <strong>Type:</strong> Hydrocolloid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-starface-hydro-stars></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Starface Hydro-Stars</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Starface Hydro-Stars" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tykRb4LwrYs6TzglblYEKBmVWT8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/starface-hydro-stars-851132995cbd46899a368fadc4ec1bf0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Starface</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter who you are, you’re a star, and these adorable stickers from Starface are your daily reminder — and celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Bieber</a> agree. Inside a convenient carrying case sits 32 star-shaped hydrocolloid patches, so you can give yourself a gold star wherever you go. These peppy pimple covers effectively calm and shrink breakouts but don’t stick on as well as some of the other picks on our list (probably in part due to their unique shape that’s more fashionable than functional), so we recommend these for daytime use rather than wearing while sleeping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that these cheery patches feel like a celebration of our skin, not in spite of our bumps, and not because of them either — but for the joyful process of showing all parts of ourselves the gentle compassion we deserve each time we stick on a yellow star.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Patches Included: </strong>32 | <strong>Type:</strong> Hydrocolloid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-cystic-acne-zitsticka-killa-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Cystic Acne</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ZitSticka Killa Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ZitSticka Killa Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qKUoE610VG-_CnSsV1K2FFBpBxk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ZitSticka-Killa-Kit-77f5119314a4494aa63ec9377db95896.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most pimple patches miss the mark on clearing out those deep, painful cysts that are too shy to show their whiteheads. That’s where microdart patches come in. Made from similar ingredients to other patches but with a unique spiky delivery system, Zitsticka’s Killa Spot Clarifying Patch Kit was made to send acne-busting salicylic acid and calming niacinamide to the hard-to-reach spots at their source.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Nazarian loves microdart pimple patches for their ability to get down deeper under the skin and explains how they work and why they’re painless. “These little spikes are tiny, tiny, tiny, so you don’t really feel anything,” says Dr. Nazarian. “It’s such a superficial penetration so that you’re barely making it past the stratum corneum, the top outer layer of the skin, which is essentially dead tissue. But microdarts target the source a little bit better. You’re trying to help deliver the ingredients that break up dead skin and calm irritation.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Applying these patches can cause a bit of discomfort but shouldn’t be more painful than the feeling of pressing on a deep spot with your bare finger. We recommend applying the Zitsticka Killa Spots with a light touch to ease tenderness. If your pimples normally come to a head, you can stick with the less-expensive hydrocolloid patches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Patches Included:</strong> 8 | <strong>Type:</strong> Microdart</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-invisible-rael-miracle-patch-invisible-spot-cover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Invisible</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rael Miracle Patch Invisible Spot Cover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rael Miracle Invisible Spot Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/r5dKRtRXp2ue_MH8A1lVrpnzCM0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rael-miracle-invisible-spot-cover-hydrocolloid-c6d8cbf8f3e44020b5a3b301627fc228.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These pimple patches are a magic wand for your spots — now you see them, now you don’t! They are by far the most invisible choice that we’ve tested, due to their unique ultra-thin beveled edges. Though the ingredient list may be simple, compared to some other options, the hydrocolloid layer is effective at removing impurities and is gentle on the skin. And with a very impressive value for the price, you’ll have patches to spare and share with your friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Patches Included: </strong>96 | <strong>Type:</strong> Hydrocolloid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-keyconcepts-hydrocolloid-acne-patch-with-tea-tree-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>KEYCONCEPTS Acne Patch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="KEYCONCEPTS Hydrocolloid Acne Patch with Tea Tree Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/y7REeRCMQm3JmURM40WLjJeYIi4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hydrocolloid-Acne-Patch-with-Tea-Tree-Oil-02db59497e854dde9c4d66d408cc53c7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Always have patches at the ready with this 120-sticker pack that includes hydrocolloid and tea tree oil. Tea tree is a calming ingredient that helps to soothe irritation and is an important part of the skin-healing process, according to Dr. Nazarian. “If you can decrease inflammation or do things that calm the skin, you’re going to prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation,” she shares. “You’re trying to minimize how much damage a pimple leaves behind.” While some might find these patches soothing, those with tea tree allergies (a more common concern than you might think) should stay away.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Patches Included:</strong> 120 | <strong>Type:</strong> Hydrocolloid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-spots-peace-out-microneedling-dark-spot-brightening-dots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Dark Spots</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Peace Out Microneedling Dark Spot Dots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Peace Out Microneedling Dark Spot Brightening Dots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3XMlqvdIJE11DmIQH49EYFGexOE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Peace-Out-Microneedling-Dark-Spot-Brightening-Dots-8e1b3147ae924651a63ce93dd0dc05cf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>If you're looking to heal an active pimple, you'll need a different patch, as these only work on acne marks.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ve finally sent that nasty pimple packing — now you just have that annoying dark mark leftover to deal with.

Dr. Nazarian explains that different types of acne need different kinds of treatment. “Little whiteheads and black heads are triggered similarly to pimples but often don’t have the same level of bacteria,” she says. She advises you to apply pimple patches to zits with a pustular head to help remove the bacteria and prevent future scarring but notes that “little blackheads don’t really scar you if you leave them alone — same with little whiteheads.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cystic or hormonal acne</a> that sits deep under the skin and causes throbbing red spots sometimes never form a whitehead.

Pimple patches that target cystic acne are made with microdarts that deliver acne-fighting ingredients deeper into the skin. These types of patches are usually more expensive per patch than those that are designed to just treat whiteheads. However, if you experience cystic acne and are looking for ways to treat it, these patches are effective.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97826086956522><p><span class=accordion__title>Should I use a pimple patch or pimple cream?</span></p><p>Pimple patches, pimple creams, and other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>acne products</a> all have their benefits, but one of the pros for pimple patches is that they create a barrier to your fingers so that you’re unable to pick at your spots, which pimple cream doesn’t prevent. “So much of acne trauma comes from picking and squeezing,” shares Dr. Nazarian. “Hydrocolloid patches are so fricking gentle, and no matter what type of skin type you have, you can handle a hydrocolloid. It’s really calming, and it helps absorb some of that extra build and calm inflammation.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word for It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cai Cramer</a> is a Commerce Writer at PEOPLE, covering the best and buzziest products across the beauty, fashion, health, and lifestyle spaces.
