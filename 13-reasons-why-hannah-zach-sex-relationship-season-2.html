When Zach got on the stand in episode 6 of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>13 Reasons Why season 2</a>, he finally revealed what really went down between them.

That’s when Zach started to let other people’s opinions of Hannah’s reflect his own. He wanted to keep their relationship a secret from everyone. They never told each other how they really felt about one another. Their relationship eventually faded into nothing, and Zach regrets how everything turned out. “</span><span class=s1>I’ll be ashamed for the rest of my life,” Zach admits.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4><span class=s1>Throughout season 2, Zach struggles with the guilt over not telling Hannah how he felt.
