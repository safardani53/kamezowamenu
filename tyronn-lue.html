Tyronn attended Raytown Senior High School in Raytown, Missouri, before attending University of Nebraska. He finished his college career ranked third all-time in assists (432), four in three-pointers and fifth in steals (154.) He was drafted by the <strong>Denver Nuggets</strong> in 1998, but was traded to the<strong> Los Angeles Lakers</strong>. While his first three years in L.A. were disappointing, he excelled in the 2001 Playoffs. While with the Lakers, Tyronn would win two NBA Championships. He would spend the next eight years with a handful of teams, including the <strong>Washington Wizards</strong>, <strong>Orlando Magic</strong>, and<strong> Atlanta Hawks</strong>. In 2009, he ended his career as a player with the Magic. Though he walked away from the court, Tyronn didn’t want away from the game. He worked from 2009-2013 as director of basketball development for the <strong>Boston Celtics</strong>. He joined the <strong>LA Clippers</strong> coaching staff that year before signing with the <strong>Cleveland Cavaliers</strong> as an associate head coach. With the mid-season firing of head coach<strong> David Blatt</strong> in 2016, Tyronn was promoted as David’s replacement. In May 2016, Tyronn became the first coach in NBA history to win his first 10 postseason games. With the Cavaliers defeating the <strong>Toronto Raptors</strong> in the 2016 Eastern Conference, Tyronn made it to the NBA Finals in his first year of coaching.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Tyronn Lue is best known as a former NBA Champion and current head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Tyronn was the highest-paid assistant coach in NBA History, signing a four-year deal worth $6.5 million dollars.
