That’s a child. That’s a dog.’ It wasn’t mean – he just seemed confused," Lena continued.</p><p>"The vibe was very much like, ‘Do I want to f-ck it? Is it wearing a … yep, it’s wearing a tuxedo.

Like, we have never met, I have no idea the kind of day he’s having or what his truth is.</p><p>"But most importantly, I would never intentionally contribute to a long and often violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies- as well as false accusations by white women towards black men.</p><p>"I’m so sorry, particularly to OBJ, who has every right to be on his cell phone.</p><p>"The fact is I don’t know about his state of mind (I don’t know a lot of things) and I shouldn’t have acted like I did."</p><p>Seems like a pretty in-depth apology to us.</p><p>Case closed?
