<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Candace Cameron Bure 'Cried Like a Baby Reading John Stamos Book</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong></a> says she “cried like a baby” hearing <a href=#><strong>John Stamos</strong></a>’ stories about the late Bob Saget in his <a href=#>If You Would Have Told Me</a> memoir, which was released late last month.</p><p>“I actually listened to it on audio and he narrates it and it’s so good. It was a beautiful book,” Cameron Bure, 47, exclusively tells Us Weekly while promoting the <a href=# rel=noopener>Generous Kids Book Club</a>. “His last chapter was all about Bob and, kind of, having closure to that part of his life — and it was really beautiful.”</p><p>Cameron Bure and Stamos, 60, starred alongside the late Saget on <a href=#>Full House</a> from 1987 to 1995. Saget <a href=#>died in January 2022</a> at age 65 as a result of “blunt head trauma” from an “accidental” fall.</p><p>Aside from the parts about her late costar, Cameron Bure says there were “so many stories” in Stamos’ book that she had “never heard” before.</p><p>“There was lots that I did know and it was just so beautiful,” she adds. “It truly was John’s heart because he’s a person who loves people and values his family so very much. And it was just a touching memoir.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Says-She-Cried-Like-a-Baby-Reading-John-Stamos-Memoir.jpg><p>Cameron Bure didn’t share any specific anecdotes but mentioned “things in the early days” were what surprised her and urged fans to “read the book” so they can experience it themselves.</p><p>Aside from supporting her former costar, Cameron Bure has a book project of her own this holiday season. The actress is assisting with the Generous Kids Book Club launch, a monthly subscription of “fantastic” children’s books and animated e-books that are “promoting values that matter,” Cameron Bure tells Us. “Values like giving and thoughtfulness and generosity and empathy and compassion.”</p><p>Cameron Bure’s love of children’s books came from her own kids. She <a href=#>shares three</a> — daughter Natasha, 25, and sons Lev, 23, and Maksim, 21 — with husband <strong>Valeri Bure</strong>.</p><p>“Reading to my kids, particularly when they were younger, it was my favorite thing to do with them,” Cameron Bure explains to Us about the partnership. “I love books. They’re a great way to teach lessons but also hear what your kids are thinking about, and it invites conversations.”</p><p>She recalled “reading in different voices” and making reading “a fun time” with her kids. With the Generous Kids Book Club, kids will get one book a month along with “all kinds of goodies, like their stickers and collector’s card, and some family discussion questions — it makes it a fun package to open.”</p><p>Not to mention, the characters are recurring in each book. While “the spotlight is on a different character each month,” they all appear in every book.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Says-She-Cried-Like-a-Baby-Reading-John-Stamos-Memoir-2.jpg><p>“They’re so cute,” she adds, teasing Jasper the Giraffe and Ellie the Elephant. “They’ve become a little family … they’re all in every book.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Preorders for the Generous Kids Book Club are available now with shipping starting on Friday, December 1.
