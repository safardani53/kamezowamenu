But there’s one thing that comes between them: a little bit of jealousy in the hair department.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 55-year-old model, who just launched an Age-Proof Hair Care System as part of her brand Meaningful Beauty, has noticed that changes in her hair have been her biggest beauty concern lately.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“For me it was like my hair finally caught up to my face,” Crawford told <a href=#>WSJ. Magazine</a> in a Thursday, June 17, interview. “As a woman, you know you’re going to get wrinkles and your hair is going to turn gray, but no one really talks about the hair itself aging.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While a good hair care routine can certainly help, the actress finds herself a little green with envy when looking at Gerber’s luscious locks. “When I look at my 19-year-old daughters hair I’m like, ‘You have my old hair; give it back.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>That said, Crawford still has some pretty shiny strands! And, it probably has a little something to do with her low-key haircare routine.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I don’t put any special product in it. I like my hair to be as clean as possible; that’s probably from years of having tons of products put into it on photo shoots,” she told the outlet.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Instead of layering on oils, texturizing spray, serums and such, she’s become a shower-and-go girl.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I’ll just brush through it before bed and then pin it up with these curved plastic tortoise hairpins into a loose chignon on the top of my head,” she explained.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Her secret weapon though is a silk pillowcase. The Fair Game star said, “I always sleep on a silk pillowcase because I feel like it helps keep my hair from getting too frizzy at night.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Crawford’s hair styling routine may be low maintenance, but she takes the rest of her nighttime ritual&nbsp; very seriously. Hydration is a must.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Chillhouse sent me their nighttime body oil, and that’s right beside my bed,” she told WSJ Magazine. “Putting it on gives my body a little hydration … If my nails and cuticles or heels are dry, then I’ll also use Lanolin Everywhere Cream on them too.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The final step before crawling into bed? Supplements. To help her get a good night’s rest, the supermodel pops one of her Beauty Sleep Supplements, which contain biotin and melatonin, to promote both sleep and hair health.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i2r7DYZpqrmaebvLOwjLCgrKCVqHq0tMRmn5qcXaCuqq2MoJyrmpWnwG60wKKpaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robyn-brown-dissed-totally-dismissed-by-former-sister-wife-christine.html><span>←</span><span>Christine Brown Makes Her Feelings About Robyn Clear</span></a>
