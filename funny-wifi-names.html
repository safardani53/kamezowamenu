If you want to see this phenomenon at its peak, we invite you to try and log on to the internet at any college dorm or university library. Everyone is eager to boast their newfound knowledge with obscure arthouse and film noir jokes.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a collection of people's best attempts at making WiFi hilarious.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These names are fresh.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: imgur</span></figure><p>When James here moved into his new apartment he started making trouble in the neighborhood — by naming his wifi network something other than a line from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme song.</p><p>I have so many questions about how this started. Was there a coordinated plan by the first floor residents, or did Apartment 1A just start the ball rolling and the rest of the people on his floor hopped on the train to see it through?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Get it?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: imgur</span></figure><p>Aww. Very punny, but also kind of sweet. Then again, this is typically a phrase uttered when someone is facing certain death, so maybe someone ought to check in on this person and make sure they're OK?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stop freeloading!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: imgur</span></figure><p>Anyone who's ever worked in a coffeeshop knows the frustration of customers who seem to think the free public wifi is an invitation to park themselves at a table, pour some (free) water, and act like it's their personal office for several hours. Not only does this frustrating entitlement mean paying customers struggle to find a table, but the shop loses out on revenue. Clearly, this Irish cafe had it with the freeloaders and christened their wifi network with a name that would drive the message home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oh snap.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: imgur</span></figure><p>The reality of apartment living is that you can pretty much hear everything your neighbors are doing, even those private moments together. Here we have a dweller who decided to inform his fellow residents he can hear them having sex. In a bold power move, another person in the building pointed out why the owner of "We Can Year You Having Sex!" might have such a problem with that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So corny.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Now this looks like a fun neighborhood for nerds who love tech puns. There's another "Tell My Wi-Fi Love Her," but personally my favorites are probably Silence of the LANs and Titanic Syncing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">CeX is a pawn store in the United Kingdom, apparently.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Much as is the case with sex, an unsecured network can leave you vulnerable to viruses, so you should probably make sure you have protection — you know, like a VPN.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Just make a noise complaint.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>In another passive aggressive network christening, one neighbor tells another resident their taste in music sucks. But I have to side with the network owner who called out that person for using "you're" instead of "your," which is way more offensive than even the most cacophonous death metal or glitch EDM.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You should see someone about that.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>The highlighted network above belongs to a urologist's office. I guess if you're going into a line of work where you're basically looking at penises all day, you've gotta maintain a healthy sense of humor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This seems like a serious neighborhood incident.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>From the looks of these network names, it seems a heist involving some fenced flamingos took place, followed by said flamingo burglar trying to turn a profit on the stolen birds. And clearly someone else close by isn't a fan. Do we need to notify the authorities?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One for the Bill Nye fans.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>While not quite as impressive as the Fresh Prince theme song train above, you gotta appreciate how all these neighboring networks paid homage to the theme song from everyone's favorite educational after-school program.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You need a high IQ to understand this one.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>The story I like to tell myself here is that one Rick and Morty fan named their network, then the second moved in and delightedly named theirs and hoping it would lead to the start of an incredible friendship. And then they traveled through dimensions together looking for Mulan Szechuan sauce.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Drama.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>The redditor who shared this one admits they were being passive aggressive when they named their wifi network in honor of the owner of an improperly parked Mercedes. Well, in keeping with the stereotype about Mercedes drivers, ostensibly the owner came back with a regularly-aggressive response: say it to my face!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">WHY NOT ZOIDBERG?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>If you love old memes and the Matt Groening cartoon Futurama, this one's for you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Beats having to pay $19.99 for an hour...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>This one is kind of sweet. Seems like someone is being neighborly and decided if you're within earshot, you can share their wifi. I might try this with a slight modification and rename mine "bring me an eggroll for password."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Too soon.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Someone warn the owner of "Abraham Linksys" above, because there's a network on the loose with its heart set on assassination.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Slow pageloads make me lose my mind</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Hey, remember LMFAO? Well, anyway, I'm sorry, but you now will have "Party Rock Anthem" stuck in your head the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does anyone object?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>While not quite as clever as "Tell my wifi love her," this one's pretty cute.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sounds like it was a fun flight.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>The redditor who shared this wifi network name was on an airplane searching for a hotspot when they came across this person. On the one hand, it's pretty cool they were able to create a hotspot at 30,00- feet. On the other hand, the least they could do is leave it open for others to use if they're up there cropdusting their fellow passengers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cache Rules Everything Around Me</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>This wi-fi ain't nothin' to F with, apparently. And if you want to beef, then bring the ruckus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">WHO DID THIS?!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>The above network was found while the redditor who shared it was visiting a nursing home. Guess everything we heard about retirement communities is true, and this particular facility has one real Lothario on their hands.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who do we believe?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>You have to admire the honesty of the network owner on the bottom here. Either way, if I lived in this building I'd be a bit concerned about the potential for noxious fumes coming from both these apartments.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">For you, no way.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Give it to me baby — the password, that is. And now that song has replaced the LMFAO song in my head. I'm not sure which is worse.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One network to rule them all.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>This is a secured network, so I'm afraid NONE SHALL PASS.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oh my.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It's pretty reasonable to assume the owners of this network are uploading some seriously NSFW content.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Don't we all?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, this pun is forever tainted for us thanks to Robert Kelly's alleged offenses.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Their poor minds.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>This network is located near an all-girls Catholic school. Either the administration has a very inappropriate sense of humor or someone who lives close by may or may not have a court mandate to stay at least 500 feet away from said school at all times.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Get rolled.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>I'm guessing the residents surrounding a Porsche dealership banded together to troll its patrons with their network names.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hodor.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>We've got a real game of thrones going here. Of course, these networks were clearly named a while ago, since House Baratheon doesn't even exist. Also, not to nitpick, but Snow is a bastard name — they don't get noble houses unless they get in really good with one of the great houses.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">#Blessed.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I love a place of worship with a sense of humor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKCloryze5FpaHFnYGZ8c4WOao6vhp2DfKfBzaewZq%2BZm7ZuusCmnKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lee-si-young-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Lee Si-young Dating Now</span></a>
