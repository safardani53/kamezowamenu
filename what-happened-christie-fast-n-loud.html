She penned an inspiring post on her Facebook page urging her fans and followers to constantly get themselves checked and not to ignore any potential health problems. The procedure wasn't without its hiccups, however, Christie's voice box was damaged:</p><p>"In the process, the nerve to my voice box was cut and I will have no voice for a while, maybe up to 6 months. I am home, and I am OK. I have a tube in my throat, but I will get that removed today and hopefully it will start to heal QUICKLY! I will have to take radiation soon and hopefully that will be the end," the post read.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Despite everything, I feel lucky and I feel blessed to have so many supportive people around me helping me and my family get through this. The reason I'm putting this out there is because I want you guys to realize how important it is to see the doctor if you have something that doesn't feel right. This journey only started 7 weeks ago and it had already progressed this far! PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR BODY! I love you guys."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She also underwent chemotherapy as part of her treatment prior to the surgery. Thankfully, today Christie is entirely cancer free and the Gas Monkey Garage Facebook page congratulated Christie on her journey in a touching December 2017 post:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Christie Brimberry married?</h2><p>Christie is married to Darren Brimberry, a successful hair stylist who owns two salons in Texas, Muse The Salon and Craft & Company Salon. They have four children together and Christie has two kids from her previous marriage. The "Balmain Extension Specialist" isn't too active on social media, but from the looks of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a>, the man clearly knows his way around hair.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's Christie Brimberry's net worth?</h2><p>Being a manager at the Gas Monkey Garage has paid off in dividends for Christie, who now enjoys an estimated net worth of $1.5 million, but there's a very good chance that it's much more than that. Although Christie describes her job as a "zookeeper" to keep the mechanics in the garage in line.</p><p>Despite the insanity that she deals with on a daily basis, Christie loves her job and says she will never leave the company due to the deep friendships she's developed with the staff at GMG.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 15th season of Fast N' Loud sounds promising.</h2><p>Richard Rawlings, founder of Gas Monkey Garage, was recently featured as a guest on the Joe Rogan podcast, and promised that Season 15 was going to be amazing for fans. He did confess, however, that getting the same deals on older cars like he used to do was next to impossible, as people recognize who he is now and figure he's got that Discovery Channel money.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In Episode 1 of the newest season, the Gas Monkey Garage crew worked to get their hands on the iconic car featured in the Steve McQueen film Bullitt. Not only did they manage to build a new-and-improved car from the movie, but they were able to refilm the iconic chase scene from it. The result? Sheer brilliance.
