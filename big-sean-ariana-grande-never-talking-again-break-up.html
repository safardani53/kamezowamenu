He has expressed to his friends and inner circle that he thinks she’s immature and selfish,” an insider told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY. “But the scary part is, it sounds like he really dislikes her so much now, that the two may never even speak again!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform UcMFmpV7]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>This Ariana and Big Sean split is&nbsp;so complicated, with both stars telling two different sides of a very dramatic story.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>For Sean, tension started in February, when Ariana failed to show up to his big show at the House Of Blues in West Holywood because she was preparing for the Grammy Awards. Things heightened when she indulged in some on-stage PDA with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>, 21, at two of her concerts.</p><h3>Ariana Grande: Is She Looking For A New Man After Big Sean Split</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>But Ariana wasn’t too thrilled with the relationship, either — especially when her man released a very <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>graphic song</a>, referencing her “billion dollar p—y,” that had her grandmother calling with questions. Eek.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>According to sources from Sean’s camp, the rapper was expecting Ariana to put up a fight&nbsp;after he told her his decision to end things, and he “most likely would have stayed with her if she made an effort.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Welp, that definitely didn’t happen!</p><h3><a href=#>Big Sean: Why He Apologized To Naya Rivera After Ariana Grande Split</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sean may be ignoring Ariana, but the break up has caused him to turn to another ex,&nbsp;<strong>Naya Rivera</strong>, despite the nasty break up&nbsp;they endured in 2014.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Sean has reached out to Naya since his split with Ariana,” an insider told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY. “He has some regrets about everything that went down with her, as well as how he publicly dissed her, and is now trying to make amends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Unfortunately for the rapper, Naya doesn’t seem too interested in talking to him right now — after all, she is recently married with a baby on the way!</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Okay,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — do you think Sean and Ari should stop talking completely? How are you feeling about this split now that it’s a few weeks out?</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>— Alyssa Norwin, reporting by Tim Plant</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH11e5JpZpuhl2LApq3NZpiroZGjrm6z0ZqlnZ1do7K3sdFmq5qkm567qHnAoJiipl2Xv6atymasqWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-nick-price-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Nick Price Dating Now</span></a>
