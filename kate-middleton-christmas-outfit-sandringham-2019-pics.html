As per tradition, the Duchess of Cambridge <strong>Kate Middleton</strong> and her family were dolled up to attend Christmas Day church services at St. Mary Magdalene in Sandringham, with the Queen. Kate<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> loves a great holiday look</a> and wore a long (and warm!) tan coat with fur detailing on the sleeves and neckline while taking the iconic walk to the church on the Queen’s estate. She paired it with a unique green hat, but Kate’s cutest accessories were <strong>Prince George</strong> and <strong>Princess Charlotte</strong>, who made their Christmas Day debuts this year alongside their parents!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Last year, recall Kate and<strong> Prince William</strong> walked side by side with a pregnant <strong>Meghan Markle</strong> and <strong>Prince Harry</strong>. Kate stunned in an all-red ensemble with a hybrid hat/headband and styled her hair in loose waves, while Meghan’s bump was on display in an all-navy look. This year, Meghan and Harry decided to skip out on the Windsor’s Christmas traditions, which include several events hosted by the Queen, and spend it with <strong>Doria Ragland</strong>, Meghan’s mom. “Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchess’ mother <strong>Doria Ragland</strong>. This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement on the matter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple also were notably absent from the Queen’s Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace, which she holds every year before traveling to Sandringham. The pair and their 7-month-old son, <strong>Archie</strong>, are in the midst of their six-week break from royal duties and reportedly traveling abroad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/royals-christas-2019-7-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kate Middleton and her family, however, were there for it all! They even were as cute as ever in their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2019 Cambridge Family Christmas card</a>, which was leaked early by a recipient of the card. In it, Kate rocked a floral Boden teal wrap dress, while Prince George wore madras shorts and a navy collared shirt, Prince Louis was charming in overalls and Princess Charlotte looked adorable in a checkered skirt and black tank top. Prince William held on to Louis, wearing a button-up blue shirt with casual rolled up sleeves. So cute!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ze5FuZqSZpJp6rrXDnaOerJ%2BjeqS00aKqraWRqHqwwdOfoK1lo5a7pb7Ip56hmZ1if3F9mGanopujZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cracker-barrel-major-change.html><span>←</span><span>Cracker Barrel makes major change to its meal offerings - and customers will love the options</span></a>
