The cozy and cuddly plush toy has amassed a gigantic following and has become a global phenomenon since debuting in 2017. Squishmallows are super soft plush toys that have been touted as Gen Alpha’s version of the iconic Beanie Beanies, and rightfully so. Each character has a super distinct personality and even has an in-depth backstory, which is what makes them so covetable and relatable. The collective toys have been seen all over TikTok and have been favored by celebrities ranging from Lady Gaga to Kim Kardashian and Jessica Simpson, to name a few. Even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>McDonald's added Squishmallows</a> to their Happy Meal toys this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Currently, there are over 1,000 characters to choose from. Curious to learn more, we spoke with Gerhard Runken, Senior Vice President of Brand & Marketing, to learn everything about the adorable plush toys, like how the name came to be, how the brand amassed such a big following, and which Squishmallows are predicted to be the most popular. “Squishmallows were developed to bring joy to fans of all ages with relatable personalities and squads that are super fun to collect and hunt,” Runken tells PEOPLE. “Squishmallows are one of those things that have struck lightning, and it all came together to strike a chord for everyone from eight [to] 108!”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you ever wondered how the name came to be, it makes a lot of sense when you hear the story. “Naming something can be challenging, but in this case, the unique one-of-a-kind feel of the plush toy gave us the name! It is super squishy when you hug it and reminds people of a marshmallow when you feel it! The combination of the two ultimately gave us the name Squishmallows.” Runken explains. And trust us, once you get one in your hands, you'll understand — it really does feel like a squishy marshmallow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ready to dive in?

He says that Squishmallows are exceptionally popular on social media, noting that they have had more than nine billion video views on TikTok and have been tagged one million+ times on Instagram. "We have a huge fan base that loves celebrating the brand! So, it’s really our core Squishmallow fans that have made the brand so popular. Also, the limited squad releases are wildly popular because of the nature of how fans collect — they collect by character, squad, color, scale, and type!"<br></p><p><br>If you're wondering if the rare nature of a Squishmallow means having to shell out more money, you'll be happy to know that that's not the case. "We don’t charge more for limited editions because we want all fans to be able to get any Squishmallows at any time — we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them!" says Runken. "And of course, we’ve got some of the world’s biggest influencers and pop-culture icons that are Squishmallows fans with recent social media shout-outs from Kim and Khloé Kardashian, Lady Gaga, Jessica Simpson, and others. All this buzz helps drive the excitement for Squishmallows, further fueling the hunt and collectability factor.”<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What’s the most popular Squishmallow?</span></p><p>“Cam the Cat was one of the first Squishmallows and is one of the most popular and iconic personalities,” reveals Runken.
