Did he do any of the above?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'TMZ' reports that "Lil" Boosie Badazz was posting links to his OnlyFans account.</h2><p>The Louisiana-based rapper went on a rant against Mark Zuckerberg, who he hilariously refers to as "Zuckinberger" in a video directed at the Facebook founder because, in Boosie's words, "bosses" need to directly speak to other "bosses."</p><p>While the rapper is irate over the fact that he's been locked out of his Instagram account, it apparently had a lot to do with the fact that he was sharing links to his OnlyFans account.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While OnlyFans are used by folks to interact with their fanbase in a variety of ways, the platform is primarily known for individuals providing subscription-based pornographic content to their followers, who pay a monthly fee to gain access to said materials.&nbsp;</p><p>As it turns out, Boosie wasn't presenting his fanbase with early samples of his work or an inside look into his creative process with his OnlyFans account.</p><p>Like many other uploaders to the service, Boosie hosted a litany of NSFW material for his fanbase, and Instagram was apparently not a big fan of this practice. Links to pornographic sites and the like are in violation of Instagram's user policy, so any person who posts those links are going to get hit with a ban, and that's exactly what happened with Lil Boosie, according to TMZ.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is that really the only reason why Lil Boosie was banned from Instagram?</h2><p>A lot of his followers have said that posting links to his OnlyFans is just the tip of the iceberg. The rapper has also shown shown nudity in several of his Instagram Live videos, according to his fans. He's also not only used a variety of foul language, but even encouraged some of his followers to join his live and engage in sexual activity.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Boosie on Instagram “put ya pussy lips on live I’ll give you a thousand dollars”</p><p>Also Boosie “I don’t know what I did but you can’t take my instagram away Mark Zuckerburger”😂🤣😂</p>— k_taylor2 (@thereal_shampoo) <a href=#>August 13, 2020</a></figure><p>In Boosie's video please to Mark Zuckerberg, he also asked the Facebook boss to take him "to orientation or something" so he can learn how to properly use the platform so he won't violate the community guidelines and get his account suspended.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Boosie reacts to his Instagram being deleted. ‘YOU NEED TO TAKE ME TO ORIENTATION OR SOMETHING’ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yFWCHrdlCw</a></p>— Saycheese TV 👄🧀 (@SaycheeseDGTL) <a href=#>August 13, 2020</a></figure><p>Several folks on social media have expressed disappointment that Boosie was gone from their IG feeds and some have even reached out to Instagram, pleading to have Boosie's account reinstated.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This was probably the most damning piece of evidence when Instagram was debating over removing Boosie’s account 😂😂 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9RLY4wLSEg</a></p>— This is an Autumn Night Stan Acct (@bigfish1906) <a href=#>August 13, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How you were VS How I was</p><p>introduced to introduced to<br>to Boosie. to Boosie <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JxY99NoHzo</a></p>— 🏆BIG REZ🏆 (@ItsBigRez) <a href=#>August 13, 2020</a></figure><p>Others believe that Boosie's forced withdrawal from the platform is well-deserved and mentioned that the rapper even noted himself he had received several warnings from Instagram's guideline policy team.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Boosie singlehandedly violated damn near every Instagram policy, and now he want special treatment lol <a href=#>https://t.co/LIXYAYFL1r</a></p>— CityBoySizzle 🇪🇹 (@whoissizzle) <a href=#>August 13, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Boosie dumbass: *breaks every IG rule</p><p>Boosie's IG: *gets deleted</p><p>Boosie dumbass: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZtqEZlHuwL</a></p>— Big Girl Slay 💋 (@Biggirlslay) <a href=#>August 13, 2020</a></figure><p>What do you think?
