In September 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that the rapper welcomed a daughter, Yani Shaw, with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Sue, in December 2018.</p><p>At the time, sources also shared that Too Short was working on a documentary with Ray J and his manager Davis Weintraub about raising their little girls in Hollywood, but it has yet to be released.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Too Short appears to have an estranged marriage with wife Erica Escarcega.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StarsOffline,</a> even though Too Short recently welcomed a daughter with Sue, it's unclear whether the rapper had officially been divorced yet from his estranged wife Erica Escarcega.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The outlet reports that Too Short and Erica jumped the broom in 2000. And unfortunately, his promiscuous lifestyle allegedly put a strain on their marriage. In fact, as of the outlet's report in 2019, it was unclear whether the estranged pair had divorced or not. Not to mention, rumors persisted that the two share a child with each other, but the Bay Area hitmaker is only a father of one.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Too Short has accumulated a sizable net worth over the years.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Too Short has done very well for himself over the years. The Bay Area MC is said to have a net worth of $15 million. This figure comes from his work as a rapper, owning his own record label, and various gigs in the film and television industries. Over the course of his career, Too Short has worked with Tupac Shakur, the Notorious B.I.G, Jay-Z, and many other influential artists in the game. So, it makes perfect sense that Too Short has been able to have this sizable nest egg in place.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Too Short</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Musician, Singer, Record Producer, Actor, Songwriter, Rapper</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $15 Million</p><p>Too Short is known for his legendary rap career as the "King of Hyphy" music in the Bay Area.</p><p><strong>Birth date:</strong> April 28, 1966</p><p><strong>Birth place:</strong> Los Angeles</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> Todd Anthony Shaw</p><p><strong>Father:</strong> Anthony Shaw</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Dorothy Shaw</p><p><strong>Marriages:</strong> Erica Escarcega (m. 2000 – ?)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> One daughter born in Dec. 2018</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Fremont High School</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Too Short found himself in hot water about colorist comments.</h2><p>In June 2020, the rapper had an interview with <a href=#>Saweetie</a> via Instagram Live.
