Well, at only 17, he became the first ever spokesmodel for CoverGirl.</p><p>Now, he’s 19 (he turns 20 later this month) and continues to be a successful influencer.</p><p>But on Friday, just two weeks before he exits his teens, he began hemorrhaging followers across all platforms.</p><p>Why? A callout video from friend and fellow beauty vlogger Tati Westbrook, titled: "BYE, SISTER."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We have a clip — the most serious excerpt — from the 40-minute video that Tati released on Friday afternoon.</p><p>But you should know that this all started when James Charles endorsed a company that sells hair vitamins.</p><p>See, his until-now good friend Tati has her own brand of Halo Beauty gummies.</p><p>James was apparently assisted by another brand’s security while at Coachella this year, and repayed them by endorsing the brand.</p><p>Tati was livid — especially when, after nine days, he still hadn’t reached out to her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"To not even get a phone call, to not even get a text a few days prior… that’s pretty typical of James Charles’ behavior," Tati says.</p><p>"From the time that I met him when he was 17," she notes. "I know that he has a way of just getting what he wants."</p><p>"And," Tati explains. "I always blamed it on his age."</p><p>But she says that James has changed more since they first met than she had ever imagined.</p><p>He is no longer a person with whom she wants to be associated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Fame, power, and a fat bank account will change almost anyone," Tati expresses.</p><p>Since his meteoric rise to fame, James has rubbed elbows with top-tier celebrities and also Katy Perry.</p><p>"And if you don’t have people that tell you to your face that you’re doing the wrong things," she notes. "You will change."</p><p>"I tried to be that person to you James, I really tried," Tati laments.</p><p>"I don’t think there is any getting through to you and I don’t want to be friends with you," she declares.</p><p>"I don’t want to be associated with you," Tati repeats. "And I need to say that very publicly so that this chapter can just be closed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tati says that she was instrumental in encouraging him early in his career.</p><p>She also accuses him of spreading malicious rumors that treat her like a villain.</p><p>But things get more serious when she begins to accuse James of being almost a predator.</p><p>"You tried to trick a straight man into thinking he’s gay yet again," Tati alleges in her video.</p><p>"Using your pain, your power, your money to play with people’s emotions," she accuses. "You’re threatening to ruin them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>What she’s talking about here is an Instagram model, pictured here, named Gage Gomez.</p><p>Gage was linked with James Charles earlier this year, and even spotted alongside him at Coachella.</p><p>(A great reminder that nothing good comes from Coachella)</p><p>James accused Gage of "using him" for social media clout, and Gage was harassed by James’ (young, impressionable) fans.</p><p>But Gage tells a very different story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Gage says that he admitted to James that he was unsure of his sexuality, but says that James then began pressuring him.</p><p>This wasn’t just sexual pressure — he says that James would insist that he make time for him, and then viciously subtweet him if he was busy.</p><p>He says that James would block and unblock him on Instagram and also invite and uninvite him to Coachella.</p><p>That sounds like toxic and even manipulative behavior.</p><p>James Charles has also been accused of being racist and transphobic, both in the past and very recently.</p><p>We can’t say that we’re sorry to see him canceled — and especially not in such a thorough way.</p><p>Remind us to never get on Tati’s bad side.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8q63Mnqpmm5iWv62x0maenqyjYrCiusKeo56cXZfGbsDAraBmr5WowaO%2BzqiiZpqpmnq0tdKtnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stanley-tam.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Stanley Tam net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
