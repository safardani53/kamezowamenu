With their styling versatility, range of styles, and overall convenience, they are the ultimate everyday shoe that — if constructed well — can provide comfort while running errands, going to work meetings, and even commuting. But, here’s the thing: In order for flats to be worth the investment (and closet space), they have to be comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“When selecting any type of shoe style, searching for comfort and support should be the number one priority to maintain good foot function, such as preserving the range of motion of the joints, decreasing foot deformities like bunions and hammertoes, and easing everyday wear and tear to avoid developing blisters, corns, and callus,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Yolanda Ragland</a>, DPM, a licensed podiatric reconstruction surgeon, tells PEOPLE. She explains that while flat shoes might seem like a comfortable shoe style, many factors make them uncomfortable — particularly the lack of support and traction in some styles. With this in mind, finding flats that provide amble support, traction, and flexibility when walking is important to ensure long-lasting comfort.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the most comfortable flats, the PEOPLE Tested team tried 29 styles across dozens of brands (including Rothy’s, VIVAIA, Birdies, Magauex, and Tory Burch), carefully considering their overall comfort as well as key details like cushion, arch support, and flexibility.

These leather flats come in two classic colors — black and taupe — and feature a pointed-toe silhouette with a contoured footbed and a little extra padding on the balls of the feet. Additionally, they feature a cut-out on the interior which allows for more flexibility and breathability.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For an under-$100 price tag, these shoes feature high-quality construction that can withstand a lot of wear and tear. They’re also versatile when styling and can easily be dressed down for more casual attire and also elevated with dressier pieces for office and more formal attire.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>4-12, in medium, wide, and narrow fits | <strong>Construction: </strong>Leather, synthetic lining | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, taupe | <strong>Style: </strong>Pointed toe</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ballet-flats-margaux-the-demi-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Ballet Flats</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Margaux The Demi Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Margaux The Demi Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LNcZoiYWbHhdBFQbsQWE1EjZer4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/margaux-the-demi-flat-34abfdd426ad49d392c8e04a10bd0013.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Temperature</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=4><li readability=0><p>They feature a classic ballet flat silhouette that is versatile enough for a variety of style preferences.</p></li><li readability=0><p>They’re constructed from a luxe, buttery soft leather material</p></li><li readability=1><p>Once broken in, they’re comfortable enough for walking long distances or being on your feet for long periods of time. &nbsp;</p></li><li readability=1><p>They have an inclusive size range with medium, narrow, and wide fits.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Demi flats from Margaux are the ultimate ballet flat style. These flats are constructed from a luxe and buttery soft leather material and are available in a variety of colors, including classics like black, saddle brown, and navy, as well as some fun color pops like cerulean blue, gold, and pink. When testing these ballet flats out, they were a tad uncomfortable when breaking in — which you can get ahead of by using moleskin padding — but, once broken in, they felt like slippers on the soles and are comfortable enough for walking long distances.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their comfort, these ballet flats feature high-quality construction and have some unique details like an adjustable cord bow that allows you to customize the fit. Speaking of fit, these also have an inclusive size range of 3 through 14, in medium, narrow, and wide silhouettes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>3-14, medium, narrow, and wide fits | <strong>Construction: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, red, saddle brown, black and navy, olive, pink, python, leopard, cerulean blue, burgundy, gold, silver, dove | <strong>Style: </strong>Ballet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ballet-flats-less-expensive-aerosoles-big-bet-ballet-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Ballet Flats, Less Expensive</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aerosoles Big Bet Ballet Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aerosoles Women's Big Bet Ballet Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/iYJ9FhWc6HNVuYkiNxRMi490Zps=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Aerosoles-Womens-Big-Bet-Ballet-Flat-3b58b8e79d4d463cb31e3f80cab823e4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>They come in wide sizing.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They cost under $100 and are available on Amazon Prime for free and fast shipping.&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They’re constructed with an added layer of shock absorption to up the comfort levels.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a less expensive ballet flat option, we were also highly impressed by the overall comfort and support provided in the Aerosoles Big Bet Ballet Flat. Available on Amazon Prime for under $100, these flats are constructed from a vegan leather material and feature lots of different comfort components, including a layer of shock absorption, flexible and durable soles with high traction (at least, for a ballet flat), and comfortable cushioning throughout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When testing these ballet flats, we were mostly impressed by the overall comfort and flexibility of these shoes. Plus, they’re super easy to break in and are great for everyday wear. While we wish the metallic buckle didn’t make as much of a statement, it’s still high-quality (and a great dupe for those who want a less expensive version of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flat</a>).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>5-12, regular and wide sizes | <strong>Construction: </strong>Vegan leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>Tan, black, black combo, black faux suede, navy, red, navy faux suede, mandarin, java faux suede, natural combo raffia, trench coat faux suede, soft gold, natural snake, pink snake, black snake | <strong>Style: </strong>Ballet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-frank-mully-round-toe-ballet-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frank Mully Round Toe Ballet Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frank Mully Women's Round Toe Ballet Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3EtemPJxj9TaAemCTX4Yi4v9GHQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-2023-10-31T115747.663-c09c00ca384d486b986bb9e9d825ff38.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frank Mully</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>These ballet flats cost under $40 and are a good Rothy’s dupe.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We love the simple style and that they come in a good range of color options.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They’re machine washable.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>We wish the soles had a little more padding but, for the price and style, they are still highly comfortable.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you want a budget-friendly ballet flat or are looking for the best Rothy’s dupe, we found it in the Frank Mully Women’s Round Toe Ballet Flat. These under-$40 ballet flats feature a knit construction that is similar to the likes of Rothy’s and VIVAIA and is machine washable, too. On top of their price, the shoes feature a comfortable cushioned insole with a flexible outsole that boasts plenty of traction for stability when walking.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>6-12 | <strong>Construction: </strong>Knit fabric | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, red, gray, apricot, brown, ecru, and 29 other colors | <strong>Style: </strong>Ballet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-traction-m-gemi-the-viviana-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Traction</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>M.

After testing several options, the M. Gemi Viviana flats are our top recommendation for this category. These flats feature a rubber outsole with lots of texture to provide traction and grip when walking. They’re also constructed with an elastic strap across the foot for added stability. When testing these flats out, we noticed how they are a lot more durable than similar flat styles, thanks to the high-quality materials used in their construction.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>35-42 | <strong>Construction: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, light beige, navy | <strong>Style: </strong>Ballet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-loafer-birdies-the-starling-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Loafer</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Birdies The Starling Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Birdies Women's Starling Flats" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Zs87oGe353hGUp8vlHPv6IMgaEs=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Birdies-Womens-Starling-Flats-bd2717ceaac74817ba6518103fe15798.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Birdies</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3><li readability=3><p>They come in over 30 different colors and prints, plus different materials like velvet, suede, and raffia.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They boast a simple yet classic design that pairs well with lots of different styles.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They’re available in wide fits.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>These flats feel as comfortable as a house shoe but with much more support.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you love the look of a loafer but want something a little closer to flats, consider The Starling from Birdies. These loafer flats come in over 30 different colors and patterns, plus a variety of materials such as suede, velvet, and raffia. They’re constructed with plenty of cushioned comfort and are reminiscent of a house shoe or slipper but with more stability so you can wear them outside. The footbed is also sturdy enough to keep its shape and support but has a layer of flexibility that adds to the overall comfort level.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>5-13, wide sizes | <strong>Construction: </strong>Leather, suede, velvet, raffia | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, brown, navy, olive, and 29 other colors, prints, and materials | <strong>Style: </strong>Loafer</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sandal-margaux-the-wrap-sandal></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Sandal</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Margaux The Wrap Sandal</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Margaux The Wrap Sandal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/sGJ0cFAQsdqD3SaFKafMdo9dFlk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Margaux-The-Wrap-Sandal-14ae83eeb86a476dadaa9ffd60f274bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Margaux</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>They can be worn casually as well as dressed up, giving them a more versatile style.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You don’t have to break them in — they’re comfortable from the first wear.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The soles are foam-padded for additional comfort.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sandals — especially flat sandals — aren’t always the most comfortable and supportive shoe styles, but The Wrap Sandal from Margaux has us convinced overwise. First and foremost, these flat sandals feature a foam-padded sole for extra cushion and comfort when walking.

Like other Rothy’s shoes, these flats are designed with a knit material derived from plastic water bottles and are machine washable for easy care. Additionally, they’re designed to hug the soles in all of the right places and provide comfort from the first wear (that means, no breaking-in required).&nbsp; We love this as a more luxe everyday option because they are simple enough to go with a variety of looks and don’t show their wear and tear, even after daily use.

This Rothy’s alternative features similar knit material derived from plastic water bottles, only with a more elevated ribbed texture. They also have a rubber outsole for added stability and we never had to break them in, so they’re comfortable from the get-go. The under-$100 Mary Jane flats are also antimicrobial and breathable, which is especially beneficial in a sweaty ballet flat shoe, and they have a chic buckle detail for added flair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>5-11 | <strong>Construction: </strong>Knit made from plastic water bottles | <strong>Colors: </strong>Navy, almond, forest green, black tweed, nude and black, navy, ruby red, denim blue | <strong>Style: </strong>Mary Jane ballet flats</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-tory-burch-minnie-travel-ballet-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wu_rZzDRwqK41-DC-BqEcikYPos=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tory-Burch-Minnie-Travel-Ballet-Flat-dfc6e2864ea24701ac4acbac3883cd0f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>They’re a classic designer ballet flat that never goes out of style.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They come in a variety of colors.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The flats feature an elastic backing, which keeps them in place on the foot.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tory Burch flats are one of those designer pieces that seemingly never go out of style. The Minnie Travel Ballet Flat is our top pick for this category because aside from their timeless design, these ballet flats are incredibly versatile, come in lots of different colors (including classic black with the gold logo buckle), and have some added features like an elastic back for a more customized and comfortable fit. When testing these out, we found that the leather material has a buttery soft texture that is flexible enough to move with the foot while remaining sturdy and supportive. We also love that they don’t pinch the sides of the feet, so you don’t experience any hot spots when breaking in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>4-13 | <strong>Construction: </strong>Leather, synthetic lining | <strong>Colors: </strong>Laguna blue, lavender, washed berry, peach, gold, black, black and gold, black patent, silver confetti, gardenia, tan, pewter, leccio, navy, seafoam | <strong>Style: </strong>Ballet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-arch-support-vionic-caroll-ballet-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Arch Support</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vionic Caroll Ballet Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Vionic Carroll Ballet Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/CV77DrC43v-Xbjqk5BLOurzuc7c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vionic-Carroll-Ballet-Flat-ec61df02a09243b98226066253f111e4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>They feature built-in arch support for longer-lasting comfort.&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The flats have elastic on the edges for a more precise fit.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They’re a ballet flat with the same support and comfort as a pair of sneakers.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ballet flats and arch support aren’t often paired together, but these Vionic flats are specifically designed to support high arches and provide lots of stability. We love these because, in addition to the arch support, the flats also feature elastic edges, providing a more precise and snug fit. And, even when wearing them for long periods of time, they feel more like a sneaker than a ballet flat. The flats are also constructed from a high-quality leather material that is meant to improve with wear. And, while they don’t come in a lot of different colors, they are available in three classics — tan, black, and navy — which are great for everyday wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>5-12, wide fits | <strong>Construction: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors: </strong>Tan, black, navy | <strong>Style: </strong>Ballet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-water-repellent-vivaia-aria-5-pointed-toe-water-repellent-ballet-flats></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Water Repellent</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vivaia Aria 5° Pointed-toe Ballet Flats</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Vivaia Pointed-Toe Water Repellent Ballet Flats" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/iHuYWIIJpMAUSbY9f3yL48phVPI=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vivaia-pointed-toe-water-repellent-ballet-flats-b843ab8b0b394eeeb15f6d19b90f2008.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vivaia</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>They’re constructed from a water-repellent material derived from recycled plastic water bottles.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They come in over 25 different colors and prints.</p></li><li readability=1><p>In addition to being water-repellent, the flats are also machine washable so you can keep them fresh.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a water-repellent option, we recommend the VIVAIA Pointed-Toe Water Repellent Ballet Flats.

In addition to comfort, materials can play a major role in your flats' overall care and wear and tear. Machine-washable knit materials are worth considering because they boast durability and hold up well over time (plus, they’re easy to keep fresh between wears). Some knit materials, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">VIVAIA Pointed-Toe Water Repellent Ballet Flats (Aria 5°)</a>, are even water-repellent, so you can wear them in rainy climates without worrying about soaking your soles or ruining your shoes.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sole<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sole is also important to look for, as this can ensure durability, stability, and traction, while also providing some shock absorption, too. Dr. Ragland recommends looking for flats with either a leather, rubber, or cork sole, as these fit the criteria and also hold up against lots of wear and tear.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To state the obvious: Comfortable flats need to be comfortable. And, while some might require a little time to break in, Dr. Ragland says they shouldn’t be uncomfortable from the get-go. “If the shoe hurts in the store, it’s going to hurt later,” she remarks. While nothing compares to trying on a pair of shoes and experiencing the comfort levels for yourself, there are some additional comfort factors to consider (especially when shopping online). First, look for features like padded heels or extra cushion on the balls of the feet. Our top pick for the best everyday flat, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Naturalizer Samantha Half d’Orsay Flat</a>, features this type of cushioning, and we definitely noticed a difference when testing it out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It also helps to consider the sizing and opt for a pair that not only fits the length of your foot but also the width. If you have wider feet, consider flats such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Margaux The Demi</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Naturalizer Samantha Half d’Orsay Flat</a>,&nbsp; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aerosoles Big Bet Ballet Flat</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Birdies The Starling</a>, which come in a wide fit.

Over the course of two weeks, the team thoroughly tested each flat by wearing them for a minimum two-hour period each day. While wearing, they carefully noted any changes to their fit, cushion, and comfort with regular wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The team also considered the overall quality and durability of materials, which styles require breaking in, and which ones are most comfortable from the get-go. Additionally, the PEOPLE Tested team made note of any special features like cushioned heels and arch support. Outside of trying them on and walking in them, the PEOPLE Tested team also bent each shoe in half to determine their overall quality and flexibility (which is major in a flat shoe).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After two weeks of testing and rigorous note-taking, we then compiled all of our insights together and compared each experience to determine which flats were most comfortable.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Ivy Ford</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-211e3c7f-f4fd-491c-9125-36daf78a9420></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.740494296578><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.91239669421488><p><span class=accordion__title>Which designer flats are most comfortable?</span></p><p>After testing several options, we found that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flats</a> are the most comfortable designer flats.

It’s also worth considering your arch height and choosing a flat that accommodates either a flat foot or high arch, depending on where you fall on the spectrum.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should I size up or down in flats?</span></p><p>While some shoe sizes might vary depending on the brand, Dr. Ragland says it’s important to stay true to size as much as possible. “Sizing up or down is not an option and is a recipe for disaster when it comes to your feet,” she explains. When shopping for a pair of flats, it’s essential to consider any fit notes on the product description page to determine whether or not they run big or small. In these cases, it might be appropriate to size up or down but, for the most part, Dr. Ragland says to avoid this shoe-shopping myth.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has written for publications such as Byrdie, InStyle, The Spruce, NYLON, and more.
