Let's take a deep dive into how she ‚Äî along with some of her other RHOP co-stars ‚Äî spent her late teens/early 20s.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Gizelle Bryant part of a sorority?</h2><p>Yes, she was! Gizelle spent her college years at Hampton University, where she earned a degree in marketing. And while she was there, the philanthropist/entrepreneur was an active member of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Gizelle seems to still have a soft spot in her heart for her old sorority decades later, judging by a series of photo booth shots she shared via Instagram in 2015. The snaps featured Gizelle wearing an AKA shirt while striking various poses when she visited the campus for homecoming.</p><p>"Wind blowing photo booth...genius!" she captioned the post with a number of hashtags proclaiming her love for both Hampton University and her sorority.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Love my Sorors!

That's because a relatively new member of their crew, <a href=#>Dr. Wendy Osefo</a>, was also an AKA sister back in the day.</p><p>Osefo, who is a political commentator as well as a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the first African cast member of the Real Housewives franchise. Gizelle told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> that she "brings all kinds of Nigerian flavor."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>‚ÄúWe haven't seen that culture and their view on America and what it means to be educated here, and how they raise their children,‚Äù Gizelle explained. ‚ÄúAnd Wendy talks about all of this, so I hope that they show it because it's different from being Black [American], migrating here from Africa now.‚Äù</p><p>Gizelle went on to describe her fellow RHOP star as ‚Äúa breath of fresh air."</p><p>"It's hard to join a group of women in this capacity that have been together for years," she told EW. "It's kind of like where do you fit in, and are you going to try too hard to fit in? And she didn't do that, she just came and was herself.

At this stage in their lives, though, they're "sisters" in a whole different way.</p><p>Be sure to watch new episodes of The Real Housewives of Potomac on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLa7sculnGaaoq6ur8CMrKarp6Kewbo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./parenting-expert-new-mums-babies-children.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What you REALLY need to buy for your baby: parenting expert reveals key things to invest in &amp;amp; how to</span></a>
